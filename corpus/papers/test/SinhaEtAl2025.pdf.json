Theory and modeling also provide a way to integrate a panoply of experimentally measured parameters, functional properties, and responses to perturbations into a physio-chemically coherent framework that reproduces the properties of the neural system of interest (Einevoll et al., 2019; Yao et al., 2022; Poirazi and Papoutsi, 2020; Gurnani and Silver, 2021; Gleeson et al., 2018; Cayco‐Gajic et al., 2017; Billings et al., 2014; Vervaeke et al., 2010; Kriener et al., 2022; Billeh et al., 2020; Markram et al., 2015).\n\nComputational models in neuroscience often focus on different levels of description. For example, a cellular physiologist may construct a complex multi-compartmental model to explain the dynamical behavior of an individual neuron in terms of its morphology, biophysical properties, and ionic conductances (Hay et al., 2011; De Schutter and Bower, 1994; Migliore et al., 2005). In contrast, to relate neural population activity to sensory processing and behavior, a systems neurophysiologist may build a circuit-level model consisting of thousands of much simpler integrate-and-fire neurons (Lapicque, 1907; Potjans and Diesmann, 2014; Brunel, 2000).\n\nDomain specific tools have been developed to aid the construction and simulation of models at varying levels of biological detail and scales. An ecosystem of diverse tools is powerful and flexible, but it also creates serious challenges for the research community (Cannon et al., 2007). Each tool typically has its own design, features, Application Programming Interface (API) and syntax, a custom set of utility libraries, and finally, a distinct machine-readable representation of the model’s physiological components. This represents a complex landscape for users to navigate. Additionally, models developed in different simulators cannot be mixed and matched or easily compared, and the translation of a model from one tool-specific implementation to another can be non-trivial and error-prone.\n\nThis fragmentation in modeling tools and approaches can act as a barrier to neuroscientists who wish to use models in their research, as well as impede how Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) models are (Wilkinson et al., 2016).\n\nTo counter fragmentation and promote cooperation and interoperability within and across fields, standardization is required. The International Neuroinformatics Co-ordinating Facility (INCF) (Abrams et al., 2022) has highlighted the need for standards to ‘make research outputs machine-readable and computable and are necessary for making research FAIR’ (INCF, 2023).\n\nIn biology, several community standards have been developed to describe experimental data (e.g. Brain Imaging Data Structure [BIDS; Gorgolewski et al., 2016], Neurodata Without Borders [NWB; Teeters et al., 2015]) and computational models (e.g. Systems Biology Markup Language [SBML; Hucka et al., 2003], CellML [Lloyd et al., 2004], Scalable Open Network Architecture TemplAte [SONATA; Dai et al., 2020], PyNN [Davison et al., 2008] and Neural Open Markup Language [NeuroML; Gleeson et al., 2010]).\n\nThese standards have enabled open and interoperable ecosystems of software applications, libraries, and databases to emerge, facilitating the sharing of research outputs, an endeavor encouraged by a growing number of funding agencies and scientific journals.\n\nThe initial version of the NeuroML standard, version 1 (NeuroMLv1), was originally conceived as a model description format (Goddard et al., 2001) and implemented as a three-layered, declarative, modular, simulator-independent language (Gleeson et al., 2010). NeuroMLv1 could describe detailed neuronal morphologies and their biophysical properties as well as specific instantiations of networks. It enabled the archiving of models in a standardized format and addressed the issue of simulator fragmentation by acting as the common language for model exchange between established simulation environments—NEURON (Hines and Carnevale, 1997), GENESIS (Bower and Beeman, 1998), and MOOSE (Ray and Bhalla, 2008).\n\nWhile solving a number of long-standing problems in computational neuroscience, NeuroMLv1 had several key limitations. The most restrictive of these was that the dynamical behavior of model elements was not formally described in the standard itself, making it only partially machine readable.

NeuroMLv2 also moved to Python as its main interface language\n                                and provides a comprehensive set of Python libraries to improve usability (Vella et al., 2014), with\n                                XML retained as a machine- readable serialization format (i.e. the form in which the model ﬁles are\n                                saved/shared).\n                                   Since its release in 2014, the NeuroMLv2 standard, the software ecosystem, and the commu-\n                                nity have all steadily grown.

A central aim of the NeuroML initiative is to enable and encourage the use of multi-detailed models of neurons and neuronal circuits in neuroscience research. The initiative takes a range of steps to achieve this aim.\n\nNeuroML provides users with a curated library of model elements that form the NeuroML standard (An index of all the model elements included in version 2.3 of NeuroML, with links to further online documentation, is provided in Tables 1 and 2; Figure 2). The standard is maintained by the NeuroML Editorial Board that has identified a fundamental set of model types to support, to ensure that a significant proportion of commonly used neurobiological modeling entities can be described with the language. This includes (but is not limited to): active membrane conductances (using Hodgkin-style [Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952] or kinetic scheme-based ionic conductances), multiple synapse and plasticity mechanisms, detailed multi-compartmental neuron models with morphologies and biophysical properties, abstract point neuron models, and networks of such cells spatially arranged in populations, connected by targeted projections, receiving spiking and currently based inputs.\n\nThe NeuroMLv2 standard consists of two levels that are designed to enable users to easily create their models without worrying about simulator-specific details. The first level defines a formal ‘schema’ for the standard model elements, their attributes/parameters (e.g. an integrate and fire cell model and its necessary attributes: a threshold parameter, a reset parameter, etc.), and the relationships between them (e.g. a network contains populations; a multi-segments). This allows the validation of the completeness of the description of individual NeuroML model elements and models, prior to simulation. The second level defines the underlying dynamical behavior of the model elements (e.g. how the time-varying membrane potential of a cell model is to be calculated). Most users do not need to interact with this level (which is enabled by LEMS), which, among other features, enables the automated translation of simulator-independent NeuroML models into simulator-specific code.\n\nThus, modelers can use the standard NeuroML elements to conveniently build simulator-independent models, while also being able to examine and extend the underlying implementations of models. As a simulator-independent language, NeuroML also promotes interoperability between different computational modeling tools, and as a result, the standard library is complemented by a large, well-maintained ecosystem of software tools that support all stages of the model life cycle—from creation, analysis, simulation, and fitting, to sharing and reuse.

A first level of validation checks the structure of individual model elements against their formal specifications contained in the NeuroML standard. The standard includes information on the parameters of each model element, restrictions on parameter values, their allowed units, their cardinality, and the location of the model element in the model hierarchy—i.e., parent/children relationships. A second level of validation includes a suite of semantic and logical checks. For example, at this level, a model of a multi-compartmental cell can be checked to ensure that all segments referenced in segment groups (e.g. the group of dendritic segments) have been defined, and only defined once with unique identifiers. A list of validation tests currently included in the NeuroML core tools can be found in Table 6. These can be run against NeuroML files at the command line or programmatically in Python (Figure 6).\n\nA key advantage of using the NeuroML2/LEMS framework is that dimensions and units are inbuilt into LEMS descriptions. This enables automated conversions of units, unit checking, together with the validation of equations. Any expressions in models which are dimensionally inconsistent will be highlighted at this stage. Note that LEMS handles unit conversions internally—modelers have flexibility in how they enter the units of parameter values (e.g. specifying conductance density in S/m or mS/cm) in the NeuroML files, with the underlying LEMS definitions ensuring that a consistent set of dimensions are used in model equations (Cannon et al., 2014). LEMS then takes care of mapping the entered units to the target simulator’s preferred units. This makes model definition, inspection, use, extension, and translation easier and less error-prone.\n\nOnce the set of NeuroML files are validated, the model can be simulated, and checks can be made to test whether execution produces consistent results (e.g. firing rate of neurons in a given population) across multiple simulators (or versions of the same simulator). For this, the OSB Model Validation (OMV) framework has been developed (Gleeson et al., 2019b). This framework can automatically check that the output (e.g. spike times) of a NeuroML model running on a given simulator is within an allowed tolerance of the expected value. OMV has been applied to NeuroML models that have been shared on OSB, to test consistent behavior of models as the models themselves, and all supported.\n\nSinha, Gleeson et al. eLife 2024;13:RP95135.

Another criteria that is relevant when choosing a simulation engine is the efficiency of simulation. Simulation engines implement different computing techniques—e.g., NetPyNE, Arbor, and EDEN support parallel execution on clusters and super computers via MPI—to enable simulation of large-scale models. Thus, for efficient large-scale simulation, users may prefer one of these simulation engines.\n\nThe preferred programming language for working with NeuroML is Python (Muller et al., 2015). A Python-based ecosystem ensures that automated simulation of models can easily be carried out either using scripts, or the command line tools.

Finally, the JupyterLab environment on OSBv2 contains all of the core NeuroML tools and various simulation engines as pre-installed software packages, ready to use.\n\n# Optimizing NeuroML models\n\nDevelopment of biologically detailed models of brain function requires that components and emergent properties match the behavior of the corresponding biology as closely as possible. Thus, fitting neurons and networks to experimental data is a critical step in the model life cycle (Rossant et al., 2011; Druckmann et al., 2007). pyNeuroML promotes data-driven modeling by providing functions to fit and optimize NeuroML models against experimental data. It includes the NeuroMLTuner module (https://pyneuroml.readthedocs.io/en/development/pyneuroml.tune.html), which builds on the Neurotune package (https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/neurotune; Vella and Gleeson, 2023) for tuning and optimizing NeuroML models against data using evolutionary computation techniques.\n\nThis module allows users to select a set of weighted features from their data to calculate the fitness of populations of candidate models. In each generation, the fittest models are found and mutated to create the next generation of models, until a set of models that best exhibit the selected data features are isolated (see Guide 6 in Table 5) (https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/OptimisingNeuroMLModels.html).\n\nThe NeuroML ecosystem includes multiple tools that also provide model fitting features. The Blue Brain Python Optimisation Library (BluePyOpt) (Van Geit et al., 2016), an extensible framework for data-driven model parameter optimization, supports exporting optimized models to NeuroML files (https://github.com/BlueBrain/BluePyOpt/blob/master/examples/neuroml/neuroml.ipynb). Similar to pyNeuroML, NetPyNE also uses the inspyred Python package (https://github.com/aarongarrett/inspyred; Sinha and Garrett, 2024) to provide evolutionary computation-based model optimization features (Dura-Bernal et al., 2019).\n\n# Sharing NeuroML models\n\nThe NeuroML ecosystem includes the advanced web-based model sharing platforms NeuroML-DB (Birgiolas et al., 2023; https://neuroml-db.org) and OSB (Gleeson et al., 2019b). These resources have been designed specifically for the dissemination of models and model elements standardized in NeuroML. The OSB platform also supports visualization, analysis, simulation, and development of NeuroML models. Researchers can create shared, collaborative NeuroML projects on it and can take advantage of the in-built automated visualization and analysis pipelines to explore and reuse models and their components.\n\nWhereas version 1 (OSBv1) focused on providing an interactive 3D interface for running pre-existing NeuroML models (e.g. sourced from linked GitHub repositories) (Gleeson et al., 2019b), OSBv2 provides cloud-based workspaces for researchers to construct NeuroML-based computational models as well as analyze, and compare them to, the experimental data on which they are based, thus facilitating data-driven computational modeling. Table 8 provides a list of stable, well-tested NeuroML compliant models from brain regions including the neocortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus, which have been shared on OSB.\n\nNeuroML-DB aims to promote the uptake of standardized NeuroML models by providing a convenient location for archiving and exploration. It includes advanced database search functions, including ontology-based search (Birgiolas et al., 2015), coupled with pre-computed analyses on models’ electrophysiological and morphological properties, as well as an indication of the relative speed of execution of different models.\n\nNeuroML’s modular nature ensures that models and their components can be easily shared with others through standard code sharing resources. The simplest way of sharing NeuroML models and components is to make their Python descriptions or their XML serializations available through these resources. Indeed, it is straightforward to make Python descriptions or the XML serializations available via different file, code (GitHub, GitLab), model sharing (ModelDB Migliore et al., 2003; McDougal et al., 2017), and archival (Zenodo, Open Science Framework) platforms, just like any other code/data produced in scientific investigations. Complex models with many components, spanning multiple files, can be shared in this manner.\n\nSinha, Gleeson et al. eLife 2024;13:RP95135.

Researchers can create shared, collaborative NeuroML projects on it and can take advantage of the in-built automated visualization and analysis pipelines to explore and reuse models and their components.\n\nWhereas version 1 (OSBv1) focused on providing an interactive 3D interface for running pre-existing NeuroML models (e.g. sourced from linked GitHub repositories) (Gleeson et al., 2019b), OSBv2 provides cloud-based workspaces for researchers to construct NeuroML-based computational models as well as analyze, and compare them to, the experimental data on which they are based, thus facilitating data-driven computational modeling. Table 8 provides a list of stable, well-tested NeuroML compliant models from brain regions including the neocortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus, which have been shared on OSB.\n\nNeuroML-DB aims to promote the uptake of standardized NeuroML models by providing a convenient location for archiving and exploration. It includes advanced database search functions, including ontology-based search (Birgiolas et al., 2015), coupled with pre-computed analyses on models’ electrophysiological and morphological properties, as well as an indication of the relative speed of execution of different models.\n\nNeuroML’s modular nature ensures that models and their components can be easily shared with others through standard code sharing resources. The simplest way of sharing NeuroML models and components is to make their Python descriptions or their XML serializations available through these resources. Indeed, it is straightforward to make Python descriptions or the XML serializations available via different file, code (GitHub, GitLab), model sharing (ModelDB Migliore et al., 2003; McDougal et al., 2017), and archival (Zenodo, Open Science Framework) platforms, just like any other code/data produced in scientific investigations. Complex models with many components, spanning multiple files, can be shared in this manner.\n\nSinha, Gleeson et al. eLife 2024;13:RP95135.

Afterwards, a page for the model can be created on OSB which lists the latest files present there, with links to OSB visualization/analysis/simulation features which can use the standardized files found in the resource.\n\nNeuroML supports the embedding of structured ontological information in model descriptions (Neal et al., 2019). Models can include NeuroLex (now InterLex) (Larson and Martone, 2013) identifiers for their components (e.g. neuro_lex_id in Figure 6). This links model components to their biological counterparts and makes them more transparent, findable, and reusable. For example, different types of neurons and brain regions have unique ontological ids. A user can use these ids to search for relevant model components on NeuroML-DB. More general information to maintain provenance can also be included in NeuroML models (https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/Provenance.html).\n\n# Reusing NeuroML models\n\nNeuroML models, once openly shared, become community resources that are accessible to all. Researchers can use models shared on NeuroML-DB and OSB without restrictions. Guide 5 in Table 5 provides an example of finding NeuroML-based model components using the API of NeuroML-DB, and creating novel models incorporating these elements.\n\nIn addition to these platforms, other experimental data and model dissemination platforms also provide standardized NeuroML versions of relevant models to promote uptake and reuse. For example, NeuroMorpho.org (Ascoli et al., 2007) includes a tool to download NeuroML compliant versions of its cellular reconstructions (https://github.com/NeuroML/Cvapp-NeuroMorpho.org, https://neuroml.org/Userdocs/Software/Tools/SWC.html). NeuroML versions of models released by organizations such as the Blue Brain Project (Markram et al., 2015) (whole cell models as well as ion channel models from Channelpedia Ranjan et al., 2011), the Allen Institute for Brain Science (Billeh et al., 2020), and the OpenWorm project (Gleeson et al., 2018) are also openly available for reuse (Table 8).\n\nNeuroML can also interact with other standards to further promote model reuse. Whereas NeuroML is a declarative standard, PyNN (Davison et al., 2008) is a procedural standard with a Python API for creating network models that can be simulated on multiple simulators. NeuroML models which are within the scope of PyNN can be converted to the PyNN format, and vice-versa. Similarly, NeuroML also interacts with SONATA (Dai et al., 2020) data format by supporting the two way conversion of the network structures of NeuroML models into SONATA. In standards not specific to neuroscience, models from the well established SBML standard (Hucka et al., 2003) can be converted to LEMS (Cannon et al., 2014), for inclusion in neuroscience-related modeling pipelines, and a subset of NeuroML/LEMS models can be exported to SBML, which allows use with simulators and analysis packages compliant to this standard, e.g., Tellurium (Choi et al., 2018). Simulation execution details of NeuroML/LEMS models can also be exported to Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML) (Waltemath et al., 2011), allowing advanced resources such as Biosimulators (Shaikh et al., 2022) (https://biosimulators.org) to feature NeuroML models.\n\nSinha, Gleeson et al. eLife 2024;13:RP95135.

The standard, therefore, evolves as new model elements are added and improved versions of the standard and associated software tool chain are regularly released to the community.","bBox":{"x":168.53,"y":79.07,"w":415,"h":435.98}},{"type":"heading","lvl":1,"value":"NeuroML is a global open community initiative","md":"# NeuroML is a global open community initiative","bBox":{"x":168.53,"y":430.06,"w":265,"h":12}},{"type":"text","value":"NeuroML is a global open community standard that is used and maintained collectively by a diverse set of stakeholders.

Its modular, hierarchical structure can define a wide range of neuronal and circuit model types including simplified representations and those with a high degree of biological detail. The standardized, machine readable format of the NeuroMLv2/LEMS framework provides a flexible, common language for communicating between a wide range of tools and simulators used to create, validate, visualize, analyze, simulate, share, and reuse models. By enabling this interoperability, NeuroMLv2 has spawned a large ecosystem of interacting tools that cover all stages of the model development life cycle, bringing greater coherence to a previously fragmented landscape. Moreover, the modular nature of the model components and hierarchical structure conferred by NeuroMLv2, combined with the flexibility of coding in Python, has created a powerful ‘building block’ approach for constructing standardized models from scratch.\n\nNeuroML has, therefore, evolved from a standardized archiving format into a mature language that supports an ecosystem of tools for the creation and execution of models that support the FAIR principles and promote open, transparent, and reproducible science.\n\n# Evolution of NeuroML and emergence of the NeuroMLv2 tool ecosystem\n\nNeuroML was conceived (Goddard et al., 2001) and developed (Gleeson et al., 2010) as a declarative XML-based framework for defining biophysical models of neurons and networks in a standardized form in order to compare model properties across simulators and to promote transparency and reuse. NeuroML version 1 achieved these aims and was mainly used to archive and visualize existing models (Gleeson et al., 2010). Building on this, the subsequent development of the NeuroMLv2/LEMS framework provided a way to describe models as a hierarchical set of components with dimensional parameters and state variables, so that their structure and dynamics are fully machine readable (Cannon et al., 2014). This enabled models to be losslessly mapped to other representations, greatly promoting interoperability between tools through read-write and automated code generation (Blundell et al., 2018). As NeuroMLv2 matured and became a community standard recognized by the INCF with a formal governance structure, an increasingly wide range of models and modeling tools have been developed or modified to be NeuroMLv2 compliant (Tables 8, 3 and 4). The core tools, maintained directly by the NeuroML developers (Figure 4), provide functionality to read, modify, or create new NeuroML models, as well as to analyze and visualize, and simulate the models. Furthermore, there are now a larger number of tools that have been developed by other members of the community (Figure 3) including a neuronal simulator designed specifically for NeuroMLv2 (Panagiotou et al., 2022). The emergence of an ecosystem of NeuroMLv2 compliant tools enables modelers to build tool chains that span the model life cycle and build and reuse standardized models.\n\n# NeuroML and other standards in computational neuroscience\n\nSeveral other standards and formats exist to support computational modeling of neuronal systems.

PyNN and SONATA are, therefore, integral parts of the wider NeuroML ecosystem.\n\n# Why using NeuroML and Python promotes the construction of FAIR models\n\nThe modular and hierarchical structure of NeuroMLv2, when combined with Python, provides a powerful combination of structured declarative elements and flexible procedural approaches that enables a ‘Lego-like’ building block approach for constructing biologically detailed models (Cayco‐Gajic et al., 2017; Billings et al., 2014; Kriener et al., 2022; Gurnani and Silver, 2021). This has been advanced by the development of pyNeuroML, which provides a single installable package offering direct access to a range of functionality for handling NeuroML models (Figure 6). Moreover, the web-based documentation of NeuroMLv2, with multiple Python scripts illustrating the usage of the language and associated tools (Table 5), has recently been updated and expanded (https://docs.neuroml.org). This provides a central resource for both new and experienced users of NeuroML supporting its use in model building. As the examples of this resource illustrate, building models using NeuroMLv2 is efficient and intuitive, as the model components are pre-made and how they fit together specified. The structured format allows APIs like libNeuroML to incorporate features such as auto-completion and inline validation of model parameters and structure as scripts are being developed. In addition, automated multi-stage model validation ensures the code, equations and internal structure are validated against the NeuroML schema minimizing human errors and model simulations outputs are within acceptable bounds (Figure 7). The NeuroMLv2 ecosystem also provides convenient ways to visualize and inspect the inner structure of models. pyNeuroML provides Python functions and corresponding command line utilities to view neuronal morphology (Figure 8), neuronal electro-physiology (Figure 10), circuit connectivity and schematics (Figure 9). In addition, custom analysis pipelines and advanced neuroinformatics resources can easily be built using the APIs. For example, loading a NeuroML model of a neuron into OSB enables visualization of the morphology and the spatial distribution of ionic conductance over the membrane as well as inspection of the conductance state variables, while the connectivity and synaptic weight matrices can be automatically displayed for circuit models (Figure 8; Gleeson et al., 2019b). Such features of OSB, which are made possible by the structured format of NeuroMLv2, promote model transparency, reproducibility, and sharing. By enabling the development and sharing of well tested and transparent models the wider NeuroMLv2 ecosystem promotes Open Science.\n\n# Limitations of NeuroML and current work\n\nA limitation of any standardized framework is that there will always be models and model elements that fall outside the current scope of the standard. Although NeuroML suffers from this limitation, the underlying LEMS-based framework provides a flexible route to develop a wide range of new types of physio-chemical models (Cannon et al., 2014). This is relatively straightforward if the new model component, such as a synaptic plasticity mechanism, fits within the existing hierarchical structure of NeuroMLv2 as the new type of synaptic element can build on an existing base synapse type which specifies the relevant input and outputs (e.g. local voltage and synaptic current). For more radical shifts in model types (e.g. neuronal morphologies that grow during learning) that do not fit neatly into the current NeuroMLv2 schema, structural changes to the language would be required. This route is more involved as the pros and cons of changes to the structure of NeuroMLv2 would need to be considered by the Scientific Committee and, if approved, implemented by the Editorial Board. Whereas the current scope of NeuroMLv2 encompasses models of spiking neurons and networks at different levels of biological detail, plans are in place to extend its scope to include more abstract, rate-based models of neuronal populations (e.g. see Wilson and Cowan, 1972; Mejias et al., 2016 in Table 8). Additionally, work is under way to extend current support for SBML (Hucka et al., 2003) based descriptions of chemical signaling pathways (Cannon et al., 2014), to enable better biochemical descriptions of sub-cellular activity in neurons and synapses. There is a growing interest in the field for the efficient generation and serialization of large-scale network models, containing numbers of neurons closer to their biological equivalents (Markram et al., 2015; Billeh et al., 2020; Einevoll et al., 2019).

By providing a stable, common framework defining the essential entities required for biologically detailed neuronal modeling, NeuroML has spawned an ecosystem of tools that span all stages of the model development life cycle. In the short term, we envision the functionality of NeuroML to expand further and for new online resources that encourage the construction of FAIR models using pyNeuroML to be taken up by the community. The NeuroML development team are also beginning to explore how to combine NeuroML-based circuit models with musculo-skeletal simulations to enable models of the neural control of behavior. In the longer term, developing seamless interfaces between NeuroML and other domain specific standards will enable the development of more holistic models of the neural control of body systems across a wide range of organisms, as well as greater exchange of models and insights between computational neuroscience and AI.\n\n# Materials and methods\n\nNeuroMLv2 is formally specified by the NeuroMLv2 XML schema, which defines the allowed structure of XML files which comply to the standard, and the LEMS ComponentType definitions, which define the internal state variables of the underlying elements, providing a machine-readable specification of the time evolution of model components. The specification is backed up by a suite of software tools that support the model life cycle and the accompanying usage and development documentation.\n\nWe illustrate the key parts of this framework using the HindmarshRose cell model (Hindmarsh and Rose, 1984; Figure 11), which as an abstract point neuron model, serves as an appropriate simple NeuroMLv2 ComponentType.\n\n# The NeuroML XML Schema\n\nWe begin with the NeuroMLv2 standard. The standard consists of two parts, each serving different functions:\n\n1. the NeuroMLv2 XML schema\n2. corresponding LEMS component type definitions\n\nThe NeuroMLv2 schema is a language independent data model that constrains the structure of a NeuroMLv2 model description.

Example model description of a HindmarshRose1984Cell NeuroML component. (a) XML serialization of the model description containing the main hindmarshRose1984Cell element with a set of parameters which result in regular bursting. A current clamp stimulus is applied using a pulseGenerator, and a population of one cell is added with this in a network. This XML can be validated against the NeuroML Schema. (b) Membrane potentials generated from a simulation of the model in (a). The LEMS simulation file to execute this is shown in Figure 15. The code used in this example is available here: https://github.com/OpenSourceBrain/HindmarshRose1984/tree/master/NeuroML2/examples.\n\nThe basic building blocks of an XSD schema are ‘simple’ or ‘complex’ types and their ‘attributes.’ All types are created as ‘extensions’ or ‘restrictions’ of other types. Complex types may contain other types and attributes whereas simple types may not. Figure 12 shows some example types defined in the NeuroMLv2 schema. For example, the Nml2Quantity_none simple type restricts the in-built ‘string’ type using a regular expression ‘pattern’ that limits what string values it can contain. The type is Nml2Quantity_none is to be used for unit-less quantities (e.g. 3, 6.7, –1.1e-5) and the restriction pattern for translates to ‘a string that may start with a hyphen (negative sign), followed by any number of numerical characters (potentially containing a decimal point) and a string containing capital or small ‘e’ (to specify the exponent).’ The restriction pattern for the Nml2Quantity_voltage type is similar, but must be followed by a ‘V’ or ‘mV.’ In this way, the restriction ensures that a value of type ‘Nml2Quantity_voltage’ represents a physical voltage quantity with units ‘V’ (volt) or ‘mV’ (millivolt). Furthermore, a NeuroMLv2 model description that uses a voltage value that does not match this pattern, for example ‘0.5 s,’ will be invalid.\n\nThe example of a complex type in Figure 12 is the HindmarshRose1984Cell type that extends the BaseCellMembPotCap complex type (the base type for any cell producing a membrane potential).\n\nSinha, Gleeson et al. eLife 2024;13:RP95135.

A complete description of LEMS is provided in Cannon et al., 2014 and in our documentation (https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/LEMSSchema.html). Here, we limit ourselves to a short summary necessary for understanding the NeuroMLv2 ComponentType definitions.\n\nLEMS allows the definition of new model types called ComponentTypes. These are formal descriptions of how a generic model element of that type behaves (the ‘dynamics’), independent of the specific set of parameters in any instance. To describe the dynamics, such descriptions must list any necessary parameters that are required, as well as the time-varying state variables. The dimensions of these parameters and state variables must be specified, and any expressions involving them must be dimensionally consistent. An instance of such a generic model is termed a Component and can be instantiated from a ComponentType by providing the necessary parameters. One can think of ComponentTypes as user defined data types similar to ‘classes’ in many programming languages and Components as ‘objects’ of these types with particular sets of parameters. Types in LEMS can also extend other types, enabling the construction of a hierarchical library of types. In addition, since LEMS is designed for model simulation, ComponentType definitions also include other simulation-related features such as Exposures, specifying quantities that may be accessed/recorded by users.\n\nFor model elements included in the NeuroML standard, there is a one-to-one mapping between types specified in the NeuroML XSD schema and LEMS ComponentTypes, with the same parameters specified in each. The addition of new model elements to the NeuroML standard, therefore, requires the addition of new type definitions to both the XSD schema and the LEMS definitions. New user defined ComponentTypes, nevertheless, can be defined in LEMS and used freely in models, and these do not need to be added to the standard before use. The only limitation here is that new user defined ComponentTypes cannot be validated against the NeuroML schema since their type definitions will not be included there.\n\nFigure 13 shows the ComponentType definition for the HindmarshRose1984Cell model element. Here, the HindmarshRose1984Cell ComponentType extends baseCellMembPotCap and inherits its elements. The ComponentType includes parameters that users must provide when creating a new instance (component): a, b, c, d, r, v, x1, v_scaling. Other parameters, x0, y0, and z0 are used to initialize the three state variables of the model, x, y, z. x is the proxy for the membrane potential of the cell used in the original formulation of the model (Hindmarsh and Rose, 1984) and is here scaled by a factor v_scaled to expose a more physiological value for the membrane potential of the cell in StateVariable v. A Constant, MSEC, is defined to hold the value of 1 ms for use in the ComponentType. Next, an Attachment enables the addition of entities that would provide external inputs to the ComponentType. Here, synapses are Attachments of the type basePointCurrent and provide synaptic current input to this ComponentType.\n\nThe Dynamics block lists the mathematical formalism required to simulate the ComponentType. By default, variables defined in the Dynamics block are private, i.e., they are not visible outside the ComponentType. To make these visible to other ComponentTypes and to allow users to record them, they must be connected to Exposures. Exposures for this ComponentType include the three state variables and also the internal derived variables, which while not used by other components, are useful in inspecting the ComponentType and its dynamics. An extra exposure, spiking, is added to allow other NeuroML components access to the spiking state of the cell that will be determined in the Dynamics block.\n\nStateVariable definitions are followed by DerivedVariables, variables whose values depend on other variables but are not time derivatives (which are handled separately in TimeDerivative blocks). The total synaptic current, iSyn, is a summation of all the synaptic currents, i received by the synapses that may be attached on to this ComponentType. The synapse[*]/i value of the select field tells LEMS to collect all the i exposures from any synapses Attachments, and the add value of the reduce field tells LEMS to sum the multiple values. As noted, x is a scaled version of the membrane potential variable, v. This is followed by the three derived variables, phi, chi, rho where:\n\n| phi | = | y − ax3 + bx2 |\n| --- | - | ------------- |\n| chi | = | c − dx2 − y   |\n\nSinha, Gleeson et al. eLife 2024;13:RP95135.

However, despite some overlap, they support different types of validation. Whereas the XSD schema allows for the validation of model descriptions (e.g. the XML files), the LEMS ComponentType definitions enable validation of model instances, i.e., the ‘runnable’ instances of models that are constructed once components have been created by instantiating ComponentTypes with the necessary parameters, and various attachments created between source and target components. A model description may be used to create many different model instances for simulation. Indeed, it is common practice to run models that include stochasticity with different seeds for random number generators to verify the robustness of simulation results. Thus, the validation of dimensions and units that LEMS carries out is done only after a runnable instance of a model has been created.\n\nThe LEMS ComponentType definitions for NeuroMLv2 are also maintained as versioned files that are updated along with the XSD schema. These can also be seen in the NeuroMLv2 GitHub repository (https://github.com/NeuroML/NeuroML2/tree/master/NeuroML2CoreTypes). An index of the ComponentTypes included in version 2.3 of the NeuroML standard, with links to online documentation, is also provided in Tables 1 and 2.\n\n# NeuroML APIs\n\nThe NeuroMLv2 software stack relies on the NeuroML APIs that provide functionality to read, write, validate, and inspect NeuroML models. The APIs are programmatically generated from the machine readable XSD schema, thus ensuring that the class for defining a specific NeuroML element in a given language (e.g. Java) has the correct set of fields with the appropriate type (e.g. float or string) corresponding to the allowed parameters in the corresponding NeuroML element. NeuroMLv2 currently provides APIs in numerous languages—Python (libNeuroML which is generated via generateDS), Java (org.neuroml model via JAXB XJC https://javaee.github.io/jaxb-v2/), C++ (NeuroML_CPP via XSD https://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/) and MATLAB (NeuroMLToolbox which accesses the Java API from MATLAB), and APIs for other languages can also be easily generated as required. LEMS is also supported by a similar set of APIs—PyLEMS in Python, and jLEMS in Java—and since a NeuroMLv2 model description is a set of LEMS Components, the LEMS APIs also support them (e.g. the hindmarshRose1984 Cell example in Figure 11 could be loaded by jLEMS and treated as a LEMS Component).\n\nFigure 14 shows the use of the NeuroML Python API to describe a model with one HindmarshRose cell. In Python, the instances of ComponentTypes, their Components, are represented as Python objects. The hr0 Python variable stores the created HindmarshRose1984 Cell component/object. This is added to a Population pop0 in the Network net. The network also includes a PulseGenerator with amplitude 5 nA as an ExplicitInput that is targeted at the cell in the population. The model description is serialized to XML (Figure 11) and validated. Note that as the standard convention for classes in Python is to use capitalized names, HindmarshRose1984Cell is used in Python but is serialized as #  in the XML.

An example simulation of the HindmarshRose model description shown in Figure 14 with the LEMS serialization shown at the bottom.

They are maintained by the NeuroML Editorial Board—jLEMS, jNeuML, and PyLEMS (Figure 4). jLEMS serves as the reference implementation for the LEMS language and as such it can simulate any model described in LEMS (not necessarily from neuroscience). When coupled with the LEMS definitions of NeuroML standard entity structure/dynamics, it can simulate most NeuroML models, though it does not currently support multi-compartmental neurons. jNeuML bundles the NeuroML standard LEMS definitions, jLEMS, and other functionality into a single package for ease of installation/usage. There is also a pure Python implementation of a LEMS interpreter, PyLEMS, which can be used in a similar way to jLEMS. The pyNeuroML package encapsulates all of these tools to give easy access (at both command line and in Python) to all of their functionality (Figure 6).\n\nThe second category consists of other simulators which support NeuroML natively. The EDEN simulator is an independently developed tool that was designed from its inception to read NeuroML and LEMS models for efficient, parallel simulation (Panagiotou et al., 2022).\n\nThe third category involves simulators which have their own internal formats and include methods to translate NeuroMLv2/LEMS models to their own formats. Examples include NetPyNE (Dura‐ Bernal et al., 2019), MOOSE (Ray and Bhalla, 2008), and N2A (Rothganger et al., 2014).\n\nThe fourth category comprises tools for which the NeuroML tools generate simulator specific scripts.

These include the PyNN package (Davison et al., 2008), which can be run in either NEURON, NEST (Gewaltig and Diesmann, 2007) or Brian, the SONATA data format (Dai et al., 2020) and the SBML standard (Hucka et al., 2003) (see Reusing NeuroML models for more details).\n\nHaving multiple strategies in place for supporting NeuroML gives more freedom to simulator developers to choose how much they wish to be involved with implementing and supporting NeuroML functionality in their applications, while maximizing the options available for end users.\n\nThe primary tool for simulating NeuroML/LEMS models via different engines is jNeuroML, which is included in pyNeuroML. jNeuroML supports all simulator engine categories (Figure 5). It includes jLEMS for simulation of LEMS and single compartmental NeuroML models. It can also pass simulations to the EDEN simulator (Panagiotou et al., 2022) for direct simulation. Using the export library (https://github.com/NeuroML/org.neuroml.export), jNeuroML can also generate import scripts for simulators (e.g. NetPyNE Dura‐Bernal et al., 2019) or convert NeuroML/LEMS models to simulator specific formats (e.g. NEURON Hines and Carnevale, 1997).\n\nSupporting a new simulation engine that requires translation of NeuroML/LEMS into another format can be done by adding a new ‘writer’ to the org. neuroml. export library. Finally, jNeuroML also includes the org. neuroml. import library that converts from other formats (e.g. SBML Hucka et al., 2003) to LEMS for combination with NeuroML models.\n\nIt is important to note though that not all NeuroML models can be exported to/are supported by each of these target simulators (Table 7). This depends on the capabilities of the simulator in question (whether it supports networks, or morphologically detailed cells) and pyNeuroML/jNeuroML will provide feedback if a feature of the model is not supported in a chosen environment.\n\nAll NeuroML and LEMS software packages are made available under FOSS licenses. The source code for all NeuroML packages and the standard can be obtained from the NeuroML GitHub organization (https://github.com/NeuroML). The NeuroML Python API (https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/libNeuroML) was developed in collaboration with the NeuralEnsemble initiative (https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/), which also maintains other commonly used Python packages such as PyNN (Davison et al., 2008), Neo (Garcia et al., 2014) and Elephant (Denker, 2018). LEMS packages are available from the LEMS GitHub organization (https://github.com/LEMS).\n\nTo ensure replication and reproduction of studies, it is important to note the exact versions of software used in studies. For NeuroML and LEMS packages, archives of each release along with citations are published on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org) to enable researchers to cite them in their work (Gleeson, 2021; Gleeson, 2024a; Gleeson et al., 2019b; Gleeson, 2024b; Sinha, 2024).\n\n# Documentation\n\nA standard and its accompanying software ecosystem must be supported by comprehensive documentation if it is to be of use to the research community. The primary NeuroML documentation for users that accompanies this paper has been consolidated into a JupyterBook (Executable Books Community, 2020) at https://docs.neuroml.org. This includes explanations of NeuroML and computational modeling concepts, interactive tutorials with varying levels of complexity, information about tools and what functions they provide to support different stages of the model life cycle. The JupyterBook framework supports ‘executable’ documentation through the inclusion of interactive Jupyter notebooks which may be run in the users’ web browser on free services such as OSBv2, https://mybinder.org/ and Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/).\n\nFinally, the machine readable nature of the schema and LEMS also enables the automated generation of human readable documentation for the standard and low level APIs (Figure 16) along with their examples (https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/Schemas/Cells.html#hindmarshrose1984cell).
