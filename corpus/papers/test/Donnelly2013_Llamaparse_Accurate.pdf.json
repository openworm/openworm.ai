How the nervous system directs sequential activation and inhibition of assemblies of neurons, however, is largely unclear. Neurotransmitters can directly activate ligand-gated ion channels at synapses, inducing rapid changes in the electrical activity of postsynaptic cells. Neuromodulators generally act through G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) that activate intracellular signaling cascades with slower but longer lasting effects. The release of neuromodulators can activate or refine basic motor patterns generated by fast-acting neurotransmitters in a neural network.\n\nIn mammals, monoamines such as serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline are associated with specific behavioral states. Adrenergic modulation provides one of the most striking examples of the coordination of behavior and physiology to reflect an internal state of stress. Adrenergic transmitters stimulate the amygdala and increase heart rate, muscle tone, oxygen supply to the brain, and the release of glucose from energy stores to prepare for a fight-or-flight response. Noradrenaline and adrenaline are not used by invertebrates, but the structurally related monoamines octopamine and tyramine are often considered as the invertebrate counterparts of these adrenergic transmitters. Octopamine and tyramine have been implicated in subordinate behavior in lobsters, the honey bee sting response, the energy metabolism of flight in locusts, aggression in crickets and fruit flies, and the escape response of C. elegans.\n\nPioneering studies in the locust, mollusks, and crustaceans have supported an \"orchestration hypothesis\" where monoamines control behavioral states through the recruitment of distinct neural circuits. However, the sensory input that triggers the release of monoamines and the molecular and neural coding of these behaviors remain poorly understood.\n\nThe C. elegans escape response consists of a behavioral sequence used by the animal to navigate away from a threatening stimulus. C. elegans moves on its side by propagating a sinusoidal wave of ventral-dorsal muscle contractions along the length of its body. Locomotion is normally accompanied by exploratory head movements in which the tip of the nose moves rapidly from side to side. Gentle touch to the head elicits a backing response and the suppression of exploratory head movements.",

There are many\n   examples          where       sequential          motor       patterns        of   specific\n   behaviors have been described in great detail. However,\n   the neural mechanisms that orchestrate a full behavioral\n   sequence are poorly understood. Gentle touch to the head\n   of the roundworm C. elegans elicits an escape response in\n   which the animal quickly moves backward. The reversal is\n   followed by a deep turn that allows the animal to change\n   its   direction of locomotion                     and move            away from           the\n   threatening stimulus. We found that the neurotransmitter\n   tyramine controls the initial reversal phase of the escape\n   response         through         the      activation        of    a    fast-acting        ion\n   channel and the later turning phase through the activation\n   of a slow-acting G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). We\n   show that this tyramine GPCR is expressed in neurons that\n   make contacts with the ventral muscles of the animal.\n   Activation of this receptor facilitates the contraction of\n   ventral muscles and thus allows the animal to turn and\n   resume locomotion in the opposite direction during its\n   escape. Our studies show how a single neurotransmitter\n   coordinates           sequential         phases        of    a   complex         behavior\n   through the activation of distinct classes of receptors.\n\n\nresponse is usually followed by a deep ventral head bend, allowing the\nanimal to make a sharp (omega) turn and change its direction of\nlocomotion. The completion of the entire escape response takes\napproximately 10 s and requires sensory processing, decision-making,\nand sequential inhibition and activation of distinct motor programs.\nTherefore, the anterior touch response is a highly orchestrated motor\n\nsequence with complexity far beyond that of a simple reflex.\n   The neural wiring diagram in combination with genetic and\nlaser ablation experiments has provided a framework for the\nneural circuit that controls the initial phase of the escape response\n[19–21]. C. elegans has a single pair of tyraminergic motor neurons\nthat    are    essential       in   coordinating          the     backing       response        with\nsuppression of head movements [13]. Synaptic activation of the\ntyramine-gated            chloride        channel,        LGC-55,           inhibits      forward\nlocomotion and induces the relaxation of neck muscle [22]. The\ncoordination          of   these     motor       programs         increases        the    animals’\nchances of escaping from predacious fungi that use constricting\nrings to catch nematodes, illustrating the vital importance of\nmonoaminergic motor control [23,24]. How this initial phase of\nthe escape response is temporally linked to later stages in which the\nanimal makes a sharp turn to navigate away from the stimulus is\nunknown. To elucidate how monoamines may orchestrate the\nactivity     of    specific     neural       circuits      in   complex         behaviors,         we\nanalyzed the role of tyramine in                    C. elegans     locomotion during the\nescape response. We show that the extrasynaptic activation of a G-\nprotein      coupled        tyramine        receptor       generates        asymmetry           in   a\nlocomotion program, thus allowing the animal to execute a deep\nventral turn and navigate away from the stimulus.\n\nResults\n\nser-2 Mutants Are Resistant to Exogenous Tyramine\n   C. elegans      become immobilized on plates containing exogenous\ntyramine in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1A and Figure S1)\n[22]. Three GPCRs have been shown to bind tyramine with high\naffinity: TYRA-2, TYRA-3, and SER-2 [25–28]. To determine\nwhether the effects of tyramine are mediated by these GPCRs, we\nexamined         the     locomotion          of    ser-2(pk1357         and      ok2103),       tyra-\n2(tm1815),        and      tyra-3(ok325)         deletion      mutants        on     agar     plates\ncontaining         exogenous          tyramine.        Wild-type,         tyra-2,     and     tyra-3\nmutant animals become immobilized on 30 mM tyramine within\n5 min      (Figure       S2).    However,          ser-2    mutant        animals        sustained\nmovement on plates containing exogenous tyramine (Figure 1A–C\nand Figure S1). Sensitivity to exogenous tyramine is restored back\nto wild-type levels in              ser-2    mutants containing a                ser-2    genomic\ntransgene        (Figure       1B,C      and      Figure      S2).     This      indicates       that\nexogenous tyramine mediates its paralytic effects through the\nhyperactivation of endogenous tyramine signaling pathways that\nare at least in part dependent on SER-2.\n    We have previously shown that activation of the tyramine-gated\nchloride channel, LGC-55, inhibits head movements and forward\nlocomotion [22]. Exogenous tyramine initially induced backward\nlocomotion and the inhibition of head movements in both the\nwild-type and ser-2 mutants. However, unlike the wild type, ser-2\nmutants recovered and resumed forward locomotion and head\nmovements within minutes. Body movements of lgc-55 mutants are\n\ninhibited,       similar      to   the    wild-type,        but     head      movements           are\nsustained       on     exogenous         tyramine         (Figure      1C,D).       lgc-55;     ser-2\ndouble mutants largely persisted both head and body movements\non exogenous tyramine, however locomotion remained slightly\nuncoordinated. This indicates that while the activation of the\nionotropic         LGC-55          and      metabotropic            SER-2         receptor        are\nrequired for paralysis, exogenous tyramine may affect locomotion\nthrough the activation of other receptors.\n    Head      movements            and     body      movements            are    controlled        by\ndistinct groups of muscles and motor neurons [13,20]. In wild-type\nanimals the inhibition of head movements occurred rapidly (half\ntime to immobilization, ti50 = 7762 s) and was followed by the\n\nslower inhibition of body movement (t i50 = kinetics\nthat     signaling       pathways         with      distinct      14963 s). This suggestscontribute to\ntyramine’s effects. The sustained body movements of ser-2 mutants\non exogenous tyramine make it difficult to dissect the effects of\nexogenous tyramine on head movements. Therefore, we analyzed\nthe effect of tyramine on head movements in an                                        unc-3(e151)\nmutant background. unc-3 mutants display few body movements,\nbut have normal head movements [29]. Head movements of ser-2\nunc-3 double mutants were inhibited on exogenous tyramine, like\nthose in the wild-type and                 unc-3 mutants (Figure 1D). Consistent\nwith     our     previous        observation          [22],      head      movements            were\nsustained in lgc-55: unc-3 double mutants. The kinetics and distinct\ninhibition of head and body movements of lgc-55 and ser-2 mutants\nindicates that exogenous tyramine induces the fast immobilization\nof head movements mainly through the hyperactivation of the\nionotropic tyramine receptor LGC-55 followed by the immobili-\nzation      of    body       movements           through         hyperactivation            of    the\nmetabotropic tyramine receptor SER-2.\n\nGao Signaling Pathway Mutants Are Resistant to\nExogenous Tyramine\n    To identify genes involved in tyramine signaling, we performed\na genetic screen for mutants that are resistant to the immobilizing\neffects of exogenous tyramine on body movements. Four isolates\nfrom this screen, zf47, zf97, zf98, and zf133, sustained movement\non plates containing 30 mM tyramine. Genetic mapping, com-\nplementation tests, and sequence analysis showed that zf47 was an\nallele of goa-1. goa-1 encodes the C. elegans ortholog of the neural G\nprotein-alpha subunit of the Gao  class. GOA-1/Gao is expressed\nthroughout          the    nervous       system       and     is   thought        to   negatively\nregulate synaptic transmission through the inhibition of EGL-30,\nthe C. elegans Gaq ortholog [30–32]. We found that zf97, zf98, and\nzf133 were alleles of dgk-1, which encodes the C. elegans ortholog of\nthe vertebrate brain diacylglycerol kinase theta (DAGh) [32,33].\n\n                         PLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org                                             2           April 2013 | Volume 11 | Issue 4 | e1001529",

Wild-type, tyra-2, and tyra-3 mutant animals become immobilized on 30 mM tyramine within 5 min (Figure S2). However, ser-2 mutant animals sustained movement on plates containing exogenous tyramine (Figure 1A–C and Figure S1). Sensitivity to exogenous tyramine is restored back to wild-type levels in ser-2 mutants containing a ser-2 genomic transgene (Figure 1B,C and Figure S2).

However, unlike the wild type, ser-2 mutants recovered and resumed forward locomotion and head movements within minutes. Body movements of lgc-55 mutants are inhibited, similar to the wild-type, but head movements are sustained on exogenous tyramine (Figure 1C,D). lgc-55; ser-2 double mutants largely persisted both head and body movements on exogenous tyramine, however locomotion remained slightly uncoordinated. This indicates that while the activation of the ionotropic LGC-55 and metabotropic SER-2 receptor are required for paralysis, exogenous tyramine may affect locomotion through the activation of other receptors.\n\nHead movements and body movements are controlled by distinct groups of muscles and motor neurons [13,20]. In wild-type animals the inhibition of head movements occurred rapidly (half time to immobilization, ti50 = 7762 s) and was followed by the slower inhibition of body movement (ti50 = 14963 s). This suggests that distinct signaling pathways contribute to tyramine’s effects. The sustained body movements of ser-2 mutants on exogenous tyramine make it difficult to dissect the effects of exogenous tyramine on head movements. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of tyramine on head movements in an unc-3(e151) mutant background. unc-3 mutants display few body movements, but have normal head movements [29]. Head movements of ser-2 unc-3 double mutants were inhibited on exogenous tyramine, like those in the wild-type and unc-3 mutants (Figure 1D). Consistent with our previous observation [22], head movements were sustained in lgc-55: unc-3 double mutants. The kinetics and distinct inhibition of head and body movements of lgc-55 and ser-2 mutants indicates that exogenous tyramine induces the fast immobilization of head movements mainly through the hyperactivation of the ionotropic tyramine receptor LGC-55 followed by the immobilization of body movements through hyperactivation of the metabotropic tyramine receptor SER-2.\n\n# Gao Signaling Pathway Mutants Are Resistant to Exogenous Tyramine\n\nTo identify genes involved in tyramine signaling, we performed a genetic screen for mutants that are resistant to the immobilizing effects of exogenous tyramine on body movements. Four isolates from this screen, zf47, zf97, zf98, and zf133, sustained movement on plates containing 30 mM tyramine. Genetic mapping, complementation tests, and sequence analysis showed that zf47 was an allele of goa-1. goa-1 encodes the *C. elegans ortholog of the neural G protein-alpha subunit of the Gao class. GOA-1/Gao is expressed throughout the nervous system and is thought to negatively regulate synaptic transmission through the inhibition of EGL-30, the C. elegans Gaq ortholog [30–32]. We found that zf97, zf98, and zf133 were alleles of dgk-1, which encodes the C. elegans* ortholog of the vertebrate brain diacylglycerol kinase theta (DAGh) [32,33].",

There are many examples where sequential motor patterns of specific behaviors have been described in great detail. However, the neural mechanisms that orchestrate a full behavioral sequence are poorly understood. Gentle touch to the head of the roundworm *C. elegans* elicits an escape response in which the animal quickly moves backward. The reversal is followed by a deep turn that allows the animal to change its direction of locomotion and move away from the threatening stimulus. We found that the neurotransmitter tyramine controls the initial reversal phase of the escape response through the activation of a fast-acting ion channel and the later turning phase through the activation of a slow-acting G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). We show that this tyramine GPCR is expressed in neurons that make contacts with the ventral muscles of the animal. Activation of this receptor facilitates the contraction of ventral muscles and thus allows the animal to turn and resume locomotion in the opposite direction during its escape. Our studies show how a single neurotransmitter coordinates sequential phases of a complex behavior through the activation of distinct classes of receptors.\n\nThe response is usually followed by a deep ventral head bend, allowing the animal to make a sharp (omega) turn and change its direction of locomotion. The completion of the entire escape response takes approximately 10 s and requires sensory processing, decision-making, and sequential inhibition and activation of distinct motor programs. Therefore, the anterior touch response is a highly orchestrated motor sequence with complexity far beyond that of a simple reflex.\n\nThe neural wiring diagram in combination with genetic and laser ablation experiments has provided a framework for the neural circuit that controls the initial phase of the escape response [19–21]. *C. elegans has a single pair of tyraminergic motor neurons that are essential in coordinating the backing response with suppression of head movements [13]. Synaptic activation of the tyramine-gated chloride channel, LGC-55, inhibits forward locomotion and induces the relaxation of neck muscle [22]. The coordination of these motor programs increases the animals’ chances of escaping from predacious fungi that use constricting rings to catch nematodes, illustrating the vital importance of monoaminergic motor control [23,24]. How this initial phase of the escape response is temporally linked to later stages in which the animal makes a sharp turn to navigate away from the stimulus is unknown. To elucidate how monoamines may orchestrate the activity of specific neural circuits in complex behaviors, we analyzed the role of tyramine in C. elegans* locomotion during the escape response. We show that the extrasynaptic activation of a G-protein coupled tyramine receptor generates asymmetry in a locomotion program, thus allowing the animal to execute a deep ventral turn and navigate away from the stimulus.",

Three GPCRs have been shown to bind tyramine with high affinity: TYRA-2, TYRA-3, and SER-2 [25–28]. To determine whether the effects of tyramine are mediated by these GPCRs, we examined the locomotion of ser-2(pk1357 and ok2103), tyra-2(tm1815), and tyra-3(ok325) deletion mutants on agar plates containing exogenous tyramine. Wild-type, tyra-2, and tyra-3 mutant animals become immobilized on 30 mM tyramine within 5 min (Figure S2). However, ser-2 mutant animals sustained movement on plates containing exogenous tyramine (Figure 1A–C and Figure S1). Sensitivity to exogenous tyramine is restored back to wild-type levels in ser-2 mutants containing a ser-2 genomic transgene (Figure 1B,C and Figure S2). This indicates that exogenous tyramine mediates its paralytic effects through the hyperactivation of endogenous tyramine signaling pathways that are at least in part dependent on SER-2.\n\nWe have previously shown that activation of the tyramine-gated chloride channel, LGC-55, inhibits head movements and forward locomotion [22].

(A) Tyramine induces immobilization in a dose-dependent manner. Shown is the percentage of animals immobilized after 10 min on agar plates supplemented with tyramine. Wild-type animals become fully immobilized at concentrations above 30 mM tyramine, while ser-2 mutants continue sustained movement. Each data point represents the mean ± the standard error of the mean (SEM) for at least three trials, totaling a minimum of 30 animals. (B) G-protein signaling mutants are resistant to the paralytic effects of exogenous tyramine. Shown is the percentage of animals that become immobilized after 10 min on 30 mM tyramine. Each bar represents the mean ± SEM for at least four trials totaling a minimum of 40 animals. (Inset) Schematic representation of the Gao and Gaq signaling pathways that modulate locomotion in C. elegans. The genetic data suggest that SER-2 acts in the Gao pathway. The names of the human orthologs are shown. Rescue denotes the transgenic line Pser-2::SER-2; ser-2(pk1357). (C, D) Tyramine affects locomotion and head movements through different mechanisms. Shown is the percentage of animals with sustained body (C) or head (D) movements on 30 mM tyramine. ser-2 mutants are partially resistant to the effects of tyramine on body movements, but not head movements. lgc-55 mutants continue to move their heads through the duration of the assay. Each data point represents the mean percentage of animals that become immobilized by tyramine each minute for 20 min ± SEM for at least six trials, totaling a minimum of 60 animals. Head movements were analyzed in an unc-3 mutant background. unc-3 mutants make few body movements but display normal head movements, and are wild-type for the ser-2 and lgc-55 loci. Statistical significance to wild-type: ***p<0.0001, two-tailed Student’s t test. See also Figures S1 and S2.\n\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001529.g001\n\ndgk-1 mutants have a reduced ability to deplete DAG generated by the egl-30/Gaq pathway [33,34]. Previously characterized null mutants for goa-1 and dgk-1 were also resistant to the paralytic effect of tyramine on both head and body movements (Figure 1B). We found that egl-30/Gaq gain-of-function mutants and mutants for eat-16, which encodes a Regulator of G-protein Signaling (RGS) protein that inhibits EGL-30 [35], are resistant to exogenous tyramine (Figure 1B). Unlike goa-1 and dgk-1 mutants, which exhibit hyperactive locomotion and egg-laying behavior, ser-2 mutants did not have obvious behavioral defects [36]. Therefore, mutations that reduce GOA-1/Gao signaling or increase EGL-30/Gaq confer resistance to exogenous tyramine. The resistance of ser-2 mutants to exogenous tyramine suggests that SER-2 signals through GOA-1/Gao to modulate locomotion.\n\nSER-2 Acts in GABAergic Neurons Where does SER-2 act to confer resistance to exogenous tyramine? A ser-2 genomic rescuing transgene restored sensitivity of ser-2 mutants to exogenous tyramine, indicating that the transgene is expressed in the cells that confer sensitivity to exogenous tyramine (Figure 1B and Figure S2). The ser-2 genomic locus is large and complex and encodes several splice variants [25,36]. To analyze the ser-2 expression pattern we expressed mCherry under the control of an 11.8 kb ser-2 promoter sequence that included the four alternative first exons. We found that our Pser-2::mCherry reporter was expressed in head muscles, as well as several neurons in the head and ventral cord. The ser-2 reporter was expressed in the first and second row of muscle cells, which are distinct from neck muscles (third and fourth row of muscle cells).\n\nPLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org\n\nApril 2013 | Volume 11 | Issue 4 | e1001529",

The           ser-2 reporter was not expressed in\ninterneurons     that    control    locomotion,      as  expression     did    not\noverlap with      Pglr-1::GFP and        Plgc-55::GFP reporters that are\nexpressed     in  the   locomotion      command        neurons     (unpublished\ndata). ser-2 reporter expression was also observed in 13 cells in the\nventral cord (Figure 2A) that send commissures to the dorsal cord.\nThe    ventral   cord    is  composed       of  excitatory    cholinergic     and\ninhibitory GABAergic motor neurons that innervate body wall\nmuscles and control locomotion. Coexpression analysis with GFP\nreporters that specifically label cholinergic or GABAergic neurons\nshowed that Pser-2::mCherry was highly expressed in a subset of\nGABAergic       motor     neurons     (Figure    2B–D).     The    same    set  of\nGABAergic motor neurons were labeled in transgenic line (Pser-\n2a::GFP)     that   expressed    a   reporter    for   the   SER-2A      isoform\n(unpublished data) [36]. GABAergic ventral nerve cord neurons\nare subdivided into 13 VD motor neurons that synapse onto the\nventral body wall muscles, and 6 DD motor neurons that synapse\nonto the dorsal body wall muscles. The cells that highly express the\nser-2 reporter do not co-label with a Pflp-13::GFP reporter, which\nis expressed in the DD motor neurons (unpublished data) [37].\nThis indicates SER-2 is specifically expressed in the GABAergic\nVD motor neurons.\n   Since    GABAergic       motor     neurons     are   required    for   normal\nlocomotion, we tested if SER-2 acts in these cells to mediate the\ninhibitory effects of tyramine on movement. No other promoters\nhave   been    described     that   specifically   drive    expression     in  the\nGABAergic VD neurons. The complexity and size of the                         ser-2\npromoter did not allow us to define promoter elements that\nspecifically drive expression in the VD neurons. We therefore\nexpressed ser-2 cDNA in all GABAergic neurons using the unc-47\npromoter (Punc-47::SER-2).          ser-2  expression in GABAergic neu-\nrons of   ser-2   mutants restored normal sensitivity to exogenous\ntyramine (Figure 2E).\n   To determine if GABA signaling affects tyramine sensitivity, we\ntested   GABA-deficient         mutants     for   sensitivity    to   exogenous\ntyramine. We found that          unc-25    mutants, which lack glutamate\ndecarboxylase required for GABA synthesis [38], were slightly\nhypersensitive to the immobilizing effects of exogenous tyramine\n(Figure 2E, Figure S4). This suggests that reduced GABA signaling\nincreases the sensitivity to exogenous tyramine, likely through the\nhyperactivation of other tyramine receptors, such as LGC-55 and\nTYRA-2. GABA deficiency suppressed the resistance phenotype\nof ser-2 mutants, since unc-25; ser-2 double mutants were nearly as\nsensitive to tyramine as unc-25         single mutants (Figure 2E). These\nepistasis experiments indicate that SER-2 acts upstream or in\nparallel   to  GABAergic        signaling    and   are   consistent    with    the\nhypothesis that SER-2 acts in the VD neurons to inhibit GABA\nsignaling and control locomotion.\n   We performed cell-specific rescue experiments to determine\nwhether     G-protein     signaling    components       are   required     in  the\nGABAergic       neurons     to   mediate     sensitivity   to   the   exogenous\ntyramine. Expression of goa-1 or eat-16 in the GABAergic neurons\n(Punc-47::GOA-1/Gao          and   Punc-47::EAT-16/RGS) of goa-1              and\neat-16   mutants,     respectively,    did    not   rescue    the   hyperactive\nlocomotion phenotype. However, goa-1 expression in GABAergic\nneurons of goa-1 mutants largely restored sensitivity to exogenous\ntyramine (Figure 2E, Figure S4). Similarly, rescue expression of\neat-16   in   GABAergic        neurons      partly    restores    sensitivity   to\nexogenous tyramine. The activation of the Gaq pathway in other\ncells may contribute to tyramine resistance phenotype in G-protein\nsignaling mutants since the sensitivity to tyramine is not completely\nrestored to wild-type levels. Nonetheless, the increased sensitivity\nof GABA-neuron-specific rescue of G-protein signaling mutants\nsuggest that exogenous tyramine induces body immobilization\nthrough     the   activation     of  SER-2A       and    a  Gao     pathway      in\nGABAergic neurons.\n\nSER-2 Inhibits Neurotransmitter Release\n   To test the hypothesis that SER-2 modulates neurotransmitter\nrelease from ventral cord motor neurons, we analyzed mutants for\ntheir   sensitivity   to   the   acetylcholinesterase      inhibitor    aldicarb.\nAldicarb     increases     acetylcholine     (ACh)     concentration       at  the\nneuromuscular junction (NMJ), causing muscle contraction and\neventual     paralysis.    Mutants     with    impaired     ACh      release   are\nresistant to aldicarb-induced paralysis [39].             egl-30/Gaq     mutants\nare resistant to aldicarb, whereas goa-1 mutants are hypersensitive\nto   aldicarb-induced        paralysis,    indicating     that    EGL-30/Gaq\nstimulates and GOA-1/Gao               inhibits ACh release from motor\nneurons [31–33]. Since body wall muscles also receive inhibitory\nGABA inputs, hypersensitivity to aldicarb can also be caused by\ndecrease in GABA release at the NMJ [40–42]. The time course of\nparalysis of ser-2 mutants induced by aldicarb was similar to the\nwild-type (Figure 3A). This may be due to the restricted expression\nof   ser-2  in   a   subset    of  GABAergic        neurons      or   insufficient\nendogenous tyramine signaling to modulate GABA release under\nregular assay conditions. We therefore generated transgenic lines\nthat overexpressed        ser-2 in all cholinergic motor neurons (Pacr-\n2::SER-2) or GABAergic (Punc-47::SER-2) motor neurons and\nanalyzed the rate of aldicarb-induced paralysis. In the absence of\nexogenous tyramine, the time course of paralysis of transgenic\nanimals that express SER-2 in cholinergic or GABAergic ventral\nnerve cord motor neurons was similar to the wild-type (Figure 3A).\nHowever, on plates that contained both aldicarb and tyramine,\nanimals that overexpressed            ser-2  in cholinergic neurons (Pacr-\n2::SER-2) were more resistant to the paralytic effects of aldicarb\nthan the wild-type. Conversely, animals that overexpressed ser-2 in\nall GABAergic neurons (Punc-47::SER-2) were hypersensitive to\nparalysis on plates containing aldicarb and tyramine (Figure 3B).\nThese data are consistent with the hypothesis that SER-2 couples\nto the GOA-1/Gaio pathway to inhibit neurotransmitter release.\n\nTyramine-Mediated Reduction in GABA Synaptic Release\nRequires SER-2\n   The GABAergic VD motor neurons that express                       ser-2  make\nsynaptic    contacts     onto    the   ventral    musculature      (Figure    4A).\nTherefore,     to   directly    evaluate    whether      tyramine     modulates\nsynaptic release of GABA from motor neurons, we measured the\nfrequency of endogenous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSCs)\nin  whole-cell     recordings     from    ventral   body    wall   muscle     cells\n(Figure 3C–H). To isolate GABA currents, recordings were made\nfrom    unc-29; acr-16     double mutants (+/+) that lack excitatory\nneurotransmission at the NMJ [43,44]. In                unc-29; acr-16     double\nmutants,     the   only   remaining      currents    are    mediated     through\nchloride permeation of the GABA A-like receptor UNC-49 [43,45].\nIn these animals, we observed high levels of endogenous IPSC\nactivity (,13 events/s) that gradually declined over the time\ncourse of the recording period (,10 min). This basal level of\ninhibitory activity is consistent with previous reports that have\nused    other,    nongenetic      approaches       to   isolate   IPSCs.

The ser-2 reporter was not expressed in interneurons that control locomotion, as expression did not overlap with Pglr-1::GFP and Plgc-55::GFP reporters that are expressed in the locomotion command neurons (unpublished data). ser-2 reporter expression was also observed in 13 cells in the ventral cord (Figure 2A) that send commissures to the dorsal cord. The ventral cord is composed of excitatory cholinergic and inhibitory GABAergic motor neurons that innervate body wall muscles and control locomotion. Coexpression analysis with GFP reporters that specifically label cholinergic or GABAergic neurons showed that Pser-2::mCherry was highly expressed in a subset of GABAergic motor neurons (Figure 2B–D). The same set of GABAergic motor neurons were labeled in transgenic line (Pser-2a::GFP) that expressed a reporter for the SER-2A isoform (unpublished data) [36]. GABAergic ventral nerve cord neurons are subdivided into 13 VD motor neurons that synapse onto the ventral body wall muscles, and 6 DD motor neurons that synapse onto the dorsal body wall muscles. The cells that highly express the ser-2 reporter do not co-label with a Pflp-13::GFP reporter, which is expressed in the DD motor neurons (unpublished data) [37]. This indicates SER-2 is specifically expressed in the GABAergic VD motor neurons.\n\nSince GABAergic motor neurons are required for normal locomotion, we tested if SER-2 acts in these cells to mediate the inhibitory effects of tyramine on movement. No other promoters have been described that specifically drive expression in the GABAergic VD neurons. The complexity and size of the ser-2 promoter did not allow us to define promoter elements that specifically drive expression in the VD neurons. We therefore expressed ser-2 cDNA in all GABAergic neurons using the unc-47 promoter (Punc-47::SER-2). ser-2 expression in GABAergic neurons of ser-2 mutants restored normal sensitivity to exogenous tyramine (Figure 2E).\n\nTo determine if GABA signaling affects tyramine sensitivity, we tested GABA-deficient mutants for sensitivity to exogenous tyramine. We found that unc-25 mutants, which lack glutamate decarboxylase required for GABA synthesis [38], were slightly hypersensitive to the immobilizing effects of exogenous tyramine (Figure 2E, Figure S4). This suggests that reduced GABA signaling increases the sensitivity to exogenous tyramine, likely through the hyperactivation of other tyramine receptors, such as LGC-55 and TYRA-2. GABA deficiency suppressed the resistance phenotype of ser-2 mutants, since unc-25; ser-2 double mutants were nearly as sensitive to tyramine as unc-25 single mutants (Figure 2E).

Expression of goa-1 or eat-16 in the GABAergic neurons (Punc-47::GOA-1/Gao and Punc-47::EAT-16/RGS) of goa-1 and eat-16 mutants, respectively, did not rescue the hyperactive locomotion phenotype. However, goa-1 expression in GABAergic neurons of goa-1 mutants largely restored sensitivity to exogenous tyramine (Figure 2E, Figure S4). Similarly, rescue expression of eat-16 in GABAergic neurons partly restores sensitivity to exogenous tyramine. The activation of the Gaq pathway in other cells may contribute to tyramine resistance phenotype in G-protein signaling mutants since the sensitivity to tyramine is not completely restored to wild-type levels. Nonetheless, the increased sensitivity of GABA-neuron-specific rescue of G-protein signaling mutants suggest that exogenous tyramine induces body immobilization through the activation of SER-2A and a Gao pathway in GABAergic neurons.\n\n# SER-2 Inhibits Neurotransmitter Release\n\nTo test the hypothesis that SER-2 modulates neurotransmitter release from ventral cord motor neurons, we analyzed mutants for their sensitivity to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb. Aldicarb increases acetylcholine (ACh) concentration at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), causing muscle contraction and eventual paralysis. Mutants with impaired ACh release are resistant to aldicarb-induced paralysis [39]. egl-30/Gaq mutants are resistant to aldicarb, whereas goa-1 mutants are hypersensitive to aldicarb-induced paralysis, indicating that EGL-30/Gaq stimulates and GOA-1/Gao inhibits ACh release from motor neurons [31–33]. Since body wall muscles also receive inhibitory GABA inputs, hypersensitivity to aldicarb can also be caused by decrease in GABA release at the NMJ [40–42]. The time course of paralysis of ser-2 mutants induced by aldicarb was similar to the wild-type (Figure 3A). This may be due to the restricted expression of ser-2 in a subset of GABAergic neurons or insufficient endogenous tyramine signaling to modulate GABA release under regular assay conditions. We therefore generated transgenic lines that overexpressed ser-2 in all cholinergic motor neurons (Pacr-2::SER-2) or GABAergic (Punc-47::SER-2) motor neurons and analyzed the rate of aldicarb-induced paralysis. In the absence of exogenous tyramine, the time course of paralysis of transgenic animals that express SER-2 in cholinergic or GABAergic ventral nerve cord motor neurons was similar to the wild-type (Figure 3A). However, on plates that contained both aldicarb and tyramine, animals that overexpressed ser-2 in cholinergic neurons (Pacr-2::SER-2) were more resistant to the paralytic effects of aldicarb than the wild-type. Conversely, animals that overexpressed ser-2 in all GABAergic neurons (Punc-47::SER-2) were hypersensitive to paralysis on plates containing aldicarb and tyramine (Figure 3B). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that SER-2 couples to the GOA-1/Gaio pathway to inhibit neurotransmitter release.\n\n# Tyramine-Mediated Reduction in GABA Synaptic Release Requires SER-2\n\nThe GABAergic VD motor neurons that express ser-2 make synaptic contacts onto the ventral musculature (Figure 4A). Therefore, to directly evaluate whether tyramine modulates synaptic release of GABA from motor neurons, we measured the frequency of endogenous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSCs) in whole-cell recordings from ventral body wall muscle cells (Figure 3C–H).

Therefore, to directly evaluate whether tyramine modulates synaptic release of GABA from motor neurons, we measured the frequency of endogenous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSCs) in whole-cell recordings from ventral body wall muscle cells (Figure 3C–H). To isolate GABA currents, recordings were made from unc-29; acr-16 double mutants (+/+) that lack excitatory neurotransmission at the NMJ [43,44]. In unc-29; acr-16 double mutants, the only remaining currents are mediated through chloride permeation of the GABA A-like receptor UNC-49 [43,45]. In these animals, we observed high levels of endogenous IPSC activity (,13 events/s) that gradually declined over the time course of the recording period (,10 min). This basal level of inhibitory activity is consistent with previous reports that have used other, nongenetic approaches to isolate IPSCs. After recording an initial 60 s period of basal activity, we switched to a bath solution containing tyramine. Within 30 s of tyramine exposure we noted a clear decrease in IPSC frequency (Figure 3E,G). The magnitude of this decrease was significantly greater than the slight decrease in IPSC frequency we observed.",

The amplitude of endogenous GABA IPSCs was\nnot significantly different between +/+ animals and ser-2 mutants\n(+/+, 29.561.4 pA; ser-2, 31.963.9 pA) and was not significantly\naffected by tyramine exposure for either strain (+/+, 26.961.2 pA;\nser-2, 30.764.4 pA), indicating that clustering and function of\npostsynaptic GABA receptors are normal in ser-2 mutants, and not\naffected by tyramine (Figure 3H). The basal IPSC frequency prior\nto tyramine exposure was also not changed significantly in                   ser-2\nmutants (+/+, 13.261.2 Hz;             ser-2, 12.562 Hz). However, the\ntyramine-mediated reduction in IPSC frequency we observed in\n+/+ animals was significantly attenuated in             ser-2  mutant animals\n(ser-2, 17%64% reduction; +/+, 35%64% reduction) such that it\nwas indistinguishable from that observed in our control recordings\nwithout tyramine (control (no tyramine), 13%66% reduction).\nAfter normalization, tyramine application reduced IPSC frequen-\ncy by 25%65% in          +/+ compared to 5%65% reduction in ser-2\nmutants (Figure 3G). Taken together, our data show that tyramine\ninhibits GABA release onto ventral body wall muscles in a SER-2-\ndependent manner.\n\nAblation of Subsets of GABAergic Motor Neurons Induces\na Navigational Bias\n   C. elegans moves on its side by propagating a sinusoidal wave of\nventral-dorsal flexures along the length of its body. GABAergic\nVD motor neurons synapse onto ventral muscles and receive\nsynaptic inputs from DA/DB cholinergic motor neurons that\nsynapse    onto     dorsal    body     wall   muscles     (Figure    4A)    [46].\nConversely, GABAergic DD motor neurons synapse onto dorsal\nmuscles and receive synaptic inputs from VA/VB cholinergic\nmotor neurons that synapse onto ventral body wall muscles. This\narrangement suggests that a body bend is generated by Ach-\n\nmediated muscle contraction on one side and GABA-mediated\nrelaxation on the contralateral side. This hypothesis is supported\nby the observation that animals in which the VD and DD neurons\nare killed by laser ablation move with a reduced wave amplitude\n[46].   The    Pser-2::GFP     and    Pflp-13::GFP      fluorescent     markers,\nwhich specifically label the 13 VD and 6 DD neurons, respectively,\nallowed us to further test the role of the VD and DD neurons in\nlaser ablation experiments. Animals in which only the VD neurons\nwere ablated still propagated a sinusoidal wave along the anterior–\nposterior axis, but displayed deeper ventral than dorsal flexures\n(Movies S1 and S2). As a consequence VD ablated animals moved\nin ventrally directed circles (radius 2.2060.29 body lengths, n = 5,\nFigure 4B,C). Conversely, animals in which the DD neurons were\nablated exhibited deeper dorsal than ventral flexures and moved in\ndorsally directed circles (radius 0.6160.11 body lengths,                 n = 10).\nGABA-deficient       unc-25    mutants made shallow body bends, but\nshowed no directional bias in their locomotion pattern. Thus, the\nspecific ablation of the VD or DD GABAergic neurons indicate\nthat asymmetric relaxation of either the ventral or dorsal body wall\nmuscles results in a directional bias in locomotion.\n\nInduction of Turning Behavior Through Optogenetic\nControl of GABAergic Motor Neurons\n   Our data suggest that the modulation of the activity of either the\nVD or DD motor neurons allows the animal to bend and steer in\neither   a  ventral    or   dorsal   direction.    To    determine      if  acute\nactivation    or  inhibition     of  a   specific   subclass    of  GABAergic\nneurons    could    induce     turning    behavior,    we   used    optogenetic\nstimulation and inhibition. The complexity of the ser-2 promoter,\nwhich contains coding sequences and alternative start sites, did not\nallow us to highly express light-activated channels in the VD\nneurons. To test whether the differential activity of the VD and\nDD motor neurons can induce bending, we generated transgenic\nanimals     that   co-expressed      the   light-activated     cation    channel\nChannelrhodopsin-2          (ChR2)     [47]   and    light-activated    chloride\npump Halorhodopsin (NpHR) [48] in the six GABAergic DD\nmotor     neurons     that   synapse     onto    the   dorsal   muscles      (Pflp-\n13::ChR2; Pflp-13::NpHR). ChR2 is activated by blue light and\ndepolarizes neurons, while NpHR is activated by green light and\nhyperpolarizes      neurons.     We    found     that  blue    light  activation\ninduced a deep ventral turn (Figure 5 and Movie S3). In contrast,\ngreen light inhibition induced a deep dorsal turn. This turning\nbehavior     was    not   observed     in   nontransgenic       animals     or  in\ntransgenic animals raised on plates without all-trans-retinal, the\nchromophore of ChR2 and NpHR. To quantify turning behavior\nwe calculated a bending index as the fraction of animals that\nturned    ventrally     or   dorsally    in   response     to   light  exposure\n(Figure 5A). A bending index of zero indicates no directional\nbias, whereas a negative or positive fraction indicates a ventral or\ndorsal bias, respectively. The bending index of                Pflp-13::ChR2/\nNpHR transgenic animals was 20.4560.04 with exposure to blue\nlight and 0.4160.06 for animals with exposure to green light. The\nflp-13   promoter also drives expression in a small set of head\nneurons in addition to the DD neurons. To determine if the\nactivation or inhibition of the DD neurons was sufficient to induce\nbending, we used an optogenetic illumination system capable of\ntracking and stimulating individual regions of a freely moving\nanimal [49]. Targeted illumination of the animal’s ventral nerve\ncord that harbors the DD neuronal cell bodies induced a tight\nventral bend in response to blue light activation and a tight dorsal\nbend in response to green light inhibition (Figure 5B and Movie\nS3). Switching between blue and green light exposure enabled the\nremote control of ventral and dorsal turning behavior in freely\nmoving     Pflp-13::ChR2/NpHR             transgenic     animals.    Thus,     the\nacute stimulation of GABA release on the dorsal side induced\nrelaxation    of   the   dorsal   muscles     resulting   in   a  ventral    turn.\nConversely, the acute inhibition of GABA release onto the dorsal\nmuscles resulted in hypercontraction of dorsal muscles and a\ndorsal bend. Our data indicate that modulating the activity of\nsubsets of GABAergic neurons synapsing onto either the dorsal\n(DD) or ventral side (VD) of the animal can induce navigational\nbias.\n\nser-2 Facilitates the Execution of Omega Turns in the\nEscape Response\n   The    expression      of  ser-2   in   the   GABAergic        VD     neurons\nsuggested a possible role in        C. elegans   navigation. However,        ser-2\nmutants moved normally and did not display a ventral or dorsal\ndirectional    bias   (Figure    4B)  possibly    through     a   lack  of basal\ntyramine to activate SER-2 during regular locomotion. We have\npreviously shown that tyramine coordinates the timing of backing\nlocomotion and the suppression of head movements in the escape\nresponse [13]. Gentle anterior touch triggers tyramine release\nfrom    the   RIM     neurons      and    the  synaptic     activation    of   the\ntyramine-gated chloride channel, LGC-55 [22]. Is SER-2 also\nrequired in the execution of the escape response? Touch-induced\nreversals are often coupled to a sharp omega turn, which allows\nthe animal to change locomotion in a direction opposite to its\noriginal course (Figures 6E and 7A) [18]. The omega turn is\ninitiated by a steep ventral bend of the head when the animal\nreinitiates forward locomotion.

The amplitude of endogenous GABA IPSCs was not significantly different between +/+ animals and ser-2 mutants (+/+, 29.561.4 pA; ser-2, 31.963.9 pA) and was not significantly affected by tyramine exposure for either strain (+/+, 26.961.2 pA; ser-2, 30.764.4 pA), indicating that clustering and function of postsynaptic GABA receptors are normal in ser-2 mutants, and not affected by tyramine (Figure 3H). The basal IPSC frequency prior to tyramine exposure was also not changed significantly in ser-2 mutants (+/+, 13.261.2 Hz; ser-2, 12.562 Hz). However, the tyramine-mediated reduction in IPSC frequency we observed in +/+ animals was significantly attenuated in ser-2 mutant animals (ser-2, 17%64% reduction; +/+, 35%64% reduction) such that it was indistinguishable from that observed in our control recordings without tyramine (control (no tyramine), 13%66% reduction). After normalization, tyramine application reduced IPSC frequency by 25%65% in +/+ compared to 5%65% reduction in ser-2 mutants (Figure 3G). Taken together, our data show that tyramine inhibits GABA release onto ventral body wall muscles in a SER-2-dependent manner.\n\n# Ablation of Subsets of GABAergic Motor Neurons Induces a Navigational Bias\n\nC. elegans moves on its side by propagating a sinusoidal wave of ventral-dorsal flexures along the length of its body. GABAergic VD motor neurons synapse onto ventral muscles and receive synaptic inputs from DA/DB cholinergic motor neurons that synapse onto dorsal body wall muscles (Figure 4A) [46]. Conversely, GABAergic DD motor neurons synapse onto dorsal muscles and receive synaptic inputs from VA/VB cholinergic motor neurons that synapse onto ventral body wall muscles. This arrangement suggests that a body bend is generated by Ach-mediated muscle contraction on one side and GABA-mediated relaxation on the contralateral side. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that animals in which the VD and DD neurons are killed by laser ablation move with a reduced wave amplitude [46]. The Pser-2::GFP and Pflp-13::GFP fluorescent markers, which specifically label the 13 VD and 6 DD neurons, respectively, allowed us to further test the role of the VD and DD neurons in laser ablation experiments. Animals in which only the VD neurons were ablated still propagated a sinusoidal wave along the anterior–posterior axis, but displayed deeper ventral than dorsal flexures (Movies S1 and S2). As a consequence VD ablated animals moved in ventrally directed circles (radius 2.2060.29 body lengths, n = 5, Figure 4B,C). Conversely, animals in which the DD neurons were ablated exhibited deeper dorsal than ventral flexures and moved in dorsally directed circles (radius 0.6160.11 body lengths, n = 10). GABA-deficient unc-25 mutants made shallow body bends, but showed no directional bias in their locomotion pattern. Thus, the specific ablation of the VD or DD GABAergic neurons indicate that asymmetric relaxation of either the ventral or dorsal body wall muscles results in a directional bias in locomotion.\n\n# Induction of Turning Behavior Through Optogenetic Control of GABAergic Motor Neurons\n\nOur data suggest that the modulation of the activity of either the VD or DD motor neurons allows the animal to bend and steer in either a ventral or dorsal direction. To determine if acute activation or inhibition of a specific subclass of GABAergic neurons could induce turning behavior, we used optogenetic stimulation and inhibition. The complexity of the ser-2 promoter, which contains coding sequences and alternative start sites, did not allow us to highly express light-activated channels in the VD neurons.

ChR2 is activated by blue light and depolarizes neurons, while NpHR is activated by green light and hyperpolarizes neurons. We found that blue light activation induced a deep ventral turn (Figure 5 and Movie S3). In contrast, green light inhibition induced a deep dorsal turn.

Touch-induced reversals are often coupled to a sharp omega turn, which allows the animal to change locomotion in a direction opposite to its original course (Figures 6E and 7A) [18]. The omega turn is initiated by a steep ventral bend of the head when the animal reinitiates forward locomotion. While the sharp bend is propagated posteriorly along the body, the head usually slides along the ventral side of the body. We analyzed turning behavior in response to gentle anterior touch. We found that the likelihood of engaging in an omega turn (.90u turn initiated by the first forward head",

(1986) [20]. Green plus signs represent excitatory\nconnections, and red minus signs indicate inhibitory connections. Sensory neurons are shown as triangles, command neurons required for\nlocomotion are hexagons, and motor neurons are depicted as circles. The compass indicates anterior (A), posterior (P), ventral (V), and dorsal (D)\ndirections. C. elegans sinusoidal locomotion is propagated by alternatively contracting and relaxing opposing ventral and dorsal body wall muscles of\nthe animal using cholinergic (DB and VB for forward and DA and VA for backward locomotion) and GABAergic (VD and DD) motor neurons. Anterior\ntouch induces the activation of the tyramine release from the RIM motor neurons (blue cells). Solid lines represent synaptic activation of LGC-55 in\nneurons and muscles (purple cells) that result in the inhibition of forward locomotion and suppression of head movement in the initial phase of the\nescape response. Dashed lines represent extrasynaptic activation of SER-2 in the GABAergic VD motor neurons (green cells). The activation of SER-2\ncauses a decrease in GABA release on the ventral side animal. This allows the hypercontraction of muscles on the ventral side of the animal, thus\nfacilitating the execution of a ventral omega turn.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001529.g007\n\nPLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org                                                         11                                 April 2013 | Volume 11 | Issue 4 | e1001529",

Synaptic connections (triangles) and gap junctions (bars) are as described by White et al. (1986) [20]. Green plus signs represent excitatory connections, and red minus signs indicate inhibitory connections. Sensory neurons are shown as triangles, command neurons required for locomotion are hexagons, and motor neurons are depicted as circles. The compass indicates anterior (A), posterior (P), ventral (V), and dorsal (D) directions. C. elegans sinusoidal locomotion is propagated by alternatively contracting and relaxing opposing ventral and dorsal body wall muscles of the animal using cholinergic (DB and VB for forward and DA and VA for backward locomotion) and GABAergic (VD and DD) motor neurons. Anterior touch induces the activation of the tyramine release from the RIM motor neurons (blue cells). Solid lines represent synaptic activation of LGC-55 in neurons and muscles (purple cells) that result in the inhibition of forward locomotion and suppression of head movement in the initial phase of the escape response. Dashed lines represent extrasynaptic activation of SER-2 in the GABAergic VD motor neurons (green cells). The activation of SER-2 causes a decrease in GABA release on the ventral side animal. This allows the hypercontraction of muscles on the ventral side of the animal, thus facilitating the execution of a ventral omega turn.\n\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001529.g007\n\nPLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 11 April 2013 | Volume 11 | Issue 4 | e1001529",

Animals      with    ablated\nGABAergic VD neurons did not have a defect in the execution\nof closed omega turns. The initiation of the omega turn may be\ntriggered by the RIV head motorneurons that innervate ventral\nneck muscles [51]. The failure of DD ablated animals to fully close\ntheir omega turns indicates that the propagation of a sharp bend\nalong the body requires the hypercontraction of ventral muscles\nand relaxation of dorsal muscles.\n   Tyramine-deficient        tdc-1   mutants      or  RIM      ablated    fail   to\nsuppress     head    movements,        make     short    reversals,    and     less\nfrequently engage in the execution of omega turns [13,51]. In\ncontrast, in response to anterior touch, ser-2 mutants suppressed\nhead movements and reversed similar to wild-type animals (Figure\nS6). Furthermore,       ser-2  mutants initiated an omega turn with a\nsteep ventral head bend at the same frequency as the wild-type\n(Figure 6A). However, once ser-2 mutants initiated the omega turn,\nthe ventral turn was less deep than the wild-type. Whereas most\nwild-type animals’ heads touched the ventral side of the body\n(86%63.6%, n = 51) during an omega turn, ser-2 mutant animals\nfailed   to   fully   close   the    omega     turn    (27%67.8%,          n = 62)\n(Figure 6B,C and Movies S4 and S5). Like the ser-2 mutants, tdc-\n1 mutants that are unable to synthesize tyramine and octopamine\n[13] failed to fully close the omega turn during the escape response\n(tdc-1 32%65.5%, n = 144). In contrast, tbh-1 mutants, which only\nlack octopamine, executed closed omega turns (tbh-1 72%67.9%,\nn = 153), comparable to the wild-type. We measured the angle of\nthe omega turn (omega angle) from the deepest most contracted\nregion of the body to the closest or touching points in the head and\ntail (Figure 6B,D). Wild-type animals typically fully closed their\nomega bend, while ser-2 mutants often failed to close omega bends,\naveraging an omega angle of 24u62.3u                (n = 62). Animals lacking\ntyramine and octopamine (tdc-1)             averaged an omega angle of\n25u63.6u, while animals lacking octopamine (tbh-1)                 alone closed\ntheir omega turn. Since touch stimuli in these assays have some\ninherent variability, we also induced reversals by optogenetic\nactivation of the touch sensory neurons. Light induces an escape\nresponse in     Pmec-4::ChR2 transgenic animals that express the\nChR2 in the touch sensory neurons [47,49,53]. We analyzed\nomega turns of       Pmec-4::ChR2 transgenic animals in response to\nblue light in both wild-type and           ser-2 mutant backgrounds. The\nlight-induced escape response of           ser-2  mutants showed a similar\ndefect in omega turns as with reversals induced by touch and had a\nlower    frequency     of   closed    omega     turns    than    the   wild-type\n(Figure 6C,D). The turning defects of              ser-2  mutants caused an\nalteration in the direction of reinitiated forward movement, or\nescape angle. In response to touch, wild-type animals and                    tbh-1\nmutants completely reversed their direction of locomotion with an\nescape    angle     of   179u65u      (n = 42)    and     177u611u       (n = 16),\nrespectively. In contrast, in response to touch,            ser-2  mutants and\ntdc-1 mutants made a more shallow escape angle, changing their\ndirection from the point of stimulus by 150u65u                    (n = 46) and\n143u66u     (n = 35) (Figure 6E,F). Genomic rescue lines partially\nrestore the omega angle defect of the mutants and restored the\nescape    angle     to   wild-type     levels.   Our     data    indicate     that\ntyraminergic activation of SER-2 facilitates the execution of a\ntight ventral bend in the escape.\n\nDiscussion\n\n   The concept of monoaminergic coding of behaviors originated\nfrom work in crustaceans and insects where fully coordinated\nbehavioral sequences can be elicited by the injections of specific\nmonoamines         into   the    nervous     system     [6,16,17].     However,\nunderstanding how sensory inputs recruit the action of mono-\namines and how changes in circuit properties affect behavior\nremains a tremendous challenge in the mammalian and even\ninsect nervous systems. Tyramine release from a single pair of\nneurons, acting on few tyramine receptors in the C. elegans nervous\nsystem with single-cell resolution, provides unique insights into\nhow monoamines orchestrate independent motor programs in a\ncomplex behavior. In this study we analyzed how the G-protein\ncoupled receptor SER-2 modulates the output of a neural circuit\nin a compound motor sequence.\n\nTyramine Inhibits GABA Release\n   Our genetic data suggest that the tyramine receptor SER-2 acts\nin a Gao  neurons where it antagonizes Gaq /EGL-30 function in(GOA-1) pathway. The Gao/GOA-1 is expressed in all\nC. elegans\nmany behaviors including locomotion, egg laying, and pharyngeal\npumping       [54,55].    Dopaminergic        and    serotonergic      G-protein\ncoupled receptors are expressed in C. elegans ventral cord neurons\nand their hyperactivation with exogenous dopamine or serotonin\ncan induce paralysis within minutes [56–59]. However, ser-2 and\nother individual biogenic amine receptor mutants have no obvious\nlocomotion defects. This indicates that Gao/GOA-1 and Gaq /\nEGL-30 integrate monaminergic signals to modulate neurotrans-\nmitter release from the motor neurons to control locomotion\n(Figure 1B). Dopamine, serotonin, and tyramine may allow the\nanimal to refine locomotory patterns during different behavioral\nstates. Gao/GOA-1 activity is thought to reduce the abundance of\nthe synaptic priming protein UNC-13 at the synapse in C. elegans\nventral    cord   neurons      [33].   Our    data   indicate    that   tyramine\nreduces GABA release from VD motor neurons in a SER-2-\ndependent manner to augment the reorientation component of the\nescape response. In this regard, SER-2 shares similarities with\nmammalian alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors that inhibit neurotrans-\nmitter release and cause vasoconstriction during a fight-or-flight\nresponse [4].\n\nTyramine Acts Through Synaptic Activation of Ionotropic\nReceptors and Extrasynaptic Activation of Metabotropic\nReceptors\n\n   Tyramine can act as a classical neurotransmitter in                  C. elegans\nthrough the synaptic activation of the tyramine-gated chloride\nchannel,     LGC-55       [22,60].    While     LGC-55       is  predominantly\nexpressed in cells that are directly synaptic to tyraminergic RIM\nneurons,     SER-2-expressing         cells  do   not    receive    direct   RIM\ninnervation, indicating that SER-2 activation occurs extrasynapti-\ncally [28,36]. In addition, ionotropic and metabotropic receptors\nhave distinct ligand affinity and signaling kinetics. Ligand-gated\nion channels like LGC-55 have a relatively low affinity for their\nligand (Kd 0.1 to 1 mM) and affect postsynaptic potentials within\nmilliseconds.     This    allows   for   fast  localized    signaling    between\nneurons and their postsynaptic partners. In contrast, G-protein\ncoupled receptors have a high affinity for their ligand (Kd 0.1–\n1 mM) and operate on timescales from seconds to minutes [61].\nSynaptic spillover from the synaptic cleft and diffusion can activate\nthese high affinity receptors that are distant from the release site.\nAs tyramine is released from a single pair of head neurons that\nextend processes into the nerve ring, the activation of SER-2 in the\nGABAergic VD neurons depends upon the diffusion of tyramine\nthrough the pseudocoelomic space to reach the VD processes\nalong the length of the body.           C. elegans has two other G-protein\ncoupled receptors, TYRA-2 and TYRA-3, in addition to SER-2\nthat bind tyramine with high affinity [26,27]. tyra-2 and tyra-3 are\n\n                    PLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org                                                   12               April 2013 | Volume 11 | Issue 4 | e1001529",

Light induces an escape response in Pmec-4::ChR2 transgenic animals that express the ChR2 in the touch sensory neurons [47,49,53]. We analyzed omega turns of Pmec-4::ChR2 transgenic animals in response to blue light in both wild-type and ser-2 mutant backgrounds. The light-induced escape response of ser-2 mutants showed a similar defect in omega turns as with reversals induced by touch and had a lower frequency of closed omega turns than the wild-type (Figure 6C,D). The turning defects of ser-2 mutants caused an alteration in the direction of reinitiated forward movement, or escape angle. In response to touch, wild-type animals and tbh-1 mutants completely reversed their direction of locomotion with an escape angle of 179u65u (n = 42) and 177u611u (n = 16), respectively. In contrast, in response to touch, ser-2 mutants and tdc-1 mutants made a more shallow escape angle, changing their direction from the point of stimulus by 150u65u (n = 46) and 143u66u (n = 35) (Figure 6E,F).

In this study we analyzed how the G-protein coupled receptor SER-2 modulates the output of a neural circuit in a compound motor sequence.\n\n# Tyramine Inhibits GABA Release\n\nOur genetic data suggest that the tyramine receptor SER-2 acts in a Gao neurons where it antagonizes Gaq /EGL-30 function in(GOA-1) pathway. The Gao/GOA-1 is expressed in all C. elegans many behaviors including locomotion, egg laying, and pharyngeal pumping [54,55]. Dopaminergic and serotonergic G-protein coupled receptors are expressed in C. elegans ventral cord neurons and their hyperactivation with exogenous dopamine or serotonin can induce paralysis within minutes [56–59]. However, ser-2 and other individual biogenic amine receptor mutants have no obvious locomotion defects. This indicates that Gao/GOA-1 and Gaq /EGL-30 integrate monaminergic signals to modulate neurotransmitter release from the motor neurons to control locomotion (Figure 1B). Dopamine, serotonin, and tyramine may allow the animal to refine locomotory patterns during different behavioral states. Gao/GOA-1 activity is thought to reduce the abundance of the synaptic priming protein UNC-13 at the synapse in C. elegans ventral cord neurons [33]. Our data indicate that tyramine reduces GABA release from VD motor neurons in a SER-2-dependent manner to augment the reorientation component of the escape response. In this regard, SER-2 shares similarities with mammalian alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors that inhibit neurotransmitter release and cause vasoconstriction during a fight-or-flight response [4].\n\n# Tyramine Acts Through Synaptic Activation of Ionotropic Receptors and Extrasynaptic Activation of Metabotropic Receptors\n\nTyramine can act as a classical neurotransmitter in C. elegans through the synaptic activation of the tyramine-gated chloride channel, LGC-55 [22,60]. While LGC-55 is predominantly expressed in cells that are directly synaptic to tyraminergic RIM neurons, SER-2-expressing cells do not receive direct RIM innervation, indicating that SER-2 activation occurs extrasynaptically [28,36]. In addition, ionotropic and metabotropic receptors have distinct ligand affinity and signaling kinetics. Ligand-gated ion channels like LGC-55 have a relatively low affinity for their ligand (Kd 0.1 to 1 mM) and affect postsynaptic potentials within milliseconds. This allows for fast localized signaling between neurons and their postsynaptic partners. In contrast, G-protein coupled receptors have a high affinity for their ligand (Kd 0.1–1 mM) and operate on timescales from seconds to minutes [61]. Synaptic spillover from the synaptic cleft and diffusion can activate these high affinity receptors that are distant from the release site. As tyramine is released from a single pair of head neurons that extend processes into the nerve ring, the activation of SER-2 in the GABAergic VD neurons depends upon the diffusion of tyramine through the pseudocoelomic space to reach the VD processes along the length of the body. C. elegans has two other G-protein coupled receptors, TYRA-2 and TYRA-3, in addition to SER-2 that bind tyramine with high affinity [26,27].",

Gao/GOA-1 activity is thought to reduce the abundance of the synaptic priming protein UNC-13 at the synapse in C. elegans ventral cord neurons [33]. Our data indicate that tyramine reduces GABA release from VD motor neurons in a SER-2-dependent manner to augment the reorientation component of the escape response.

Furthermore, no tyramine or\noctopamine reuptake transporter has been identified in either C.\nelegans or  Drosophila, which suggests that tyramine diffusion from\nthe synaptic cleft is part of its mechanism of action. Serotonin,\ndopamine, and octopamine receptors are also expressed in many\nC. elegans   cells that are not directly postsynaptic to the small\nnumber of monoaminergic neurons that release them [36,58].\nSimilarly, in humans the monoaminergic cells are grouped in\nrelative small nuclei that can affect large areas of the CNS or the\nperiphery     that   do   not    receive   direct    synaptic    inputs.    Thus,\nmonoamines are not confined to the anatomical connectome\nand can reconfigure outputs to large neuronal ensembles [63].\n\nTyramine Temporally Coordinates Independent Motor\nPrograms in a Complex Behavior\n   The translation of sensory input into goal-directed behaviors\nrequires    the    temporal      coordination       of   independent       motor\nprograms. In response to gentle touch to the head,                     C. elegans\nengages in a compound motor sequence that allows the animal to\nretreat and navigate away from a touch stimulus (Figure 7A). In\nthe   base    state,   (I)  forward     locomotion       is  accompanied        by\nexploratory head movements in which the tip of the nose moves\nfrom side to side. Gentle touch to the head of C. elegans elicits an\nescape    response     where     the   animal     reverses    its  direction     of\nlocomotion while suppressing its exploratory head movements\n(II). Classic laser ablation experiments by Chalfie et al. (1985) [19]\ncomplemented by the known neural wiring diagram support a\nmodel in which the touch sensory neurons (ALM/AVM) inhibit\nthe forward locomotion ‘‘command’’ neurons (PVC/AVB) and\nactivate the backward locomotion ‘‘command’’ neurons (AVD/\nAVA), causing the animal to move backward away from the\nstimulus (Figure 7B). The AVA backward locomotion ‘‘command’’\nneurons activate the electrically coupled tyraminergic RIM motor\nneurons, which exhibit coactivated calcium transients with the\nAVA     [64,65].    Tyramine       release   from    the   RIM     induces     the\nsuppression of head movements through the activation of the fast-\nacting inhibitory chloride channel, LGC-55, in neck muscles and\ncholinergic motor neurons that control head movements [13,22].\nActivation of LGC-55 in the AVB forward locomotion ‘‘com-\nmand’’ neurons further inhibits forward locomotion, stimulating\nlong reversals that are coupled to the initiation of an omega turn\n[50,51]. The reversal is followed by a deep ventral head bend (III),\nallowing the animal to make a sharp (omega) turn (IV) where the\nhead of the animal slides along the ventral side of the body and\nresumes forward locomotion (I). Our data show that extrasynaptic\nactivation of the G-protein coupled tyramine receptor SER-2\ncontributes to the proper execution of the omega turn during the\nlast stage of the escape response. The RIV and SMD head motor\nneurons have been implicated in the ventral head bend that\ninitiates the omega turn [51]. ser-2 mutants properly initiate the\nturn but bend less deep and the head often fails to touch the tail\nduring the omega turn (IV).\n   C. elegans locomotion is controlled by cholinergic (A and B) and\nGABAergic (D) motor neurons that propel a wave of ventral-\ndorsal muscle flexures along the length of the body. We show that\nSER-2 inhibits neurotransmitter release from the GABAergic VD\nneurons. VD motor neurons release GABA on ventral body wall\nmuscles and receive inputs from cholinergic DB neurons that\nsynapse onto dorsal muscles. The DD motor neurons receive input\nfrom cholinergic VB motor neurons and release GABA on dorsal\nbody wall muscles (Figure 4A) [20]. This organization indicates\nthat GABAergic motor neurons are essential for contralateral\nmuscle relaxation, thus promoting local bending during wave\npropagation [46].\n   While spatial orientation in response to sensory stimuli is a\nfundamental component of animal behavior, the neural correlates\nare poorly understood. To change its direction of movement and\nnavigate its environment, an animal needs to generate asymmetry\nin its locomotion pattern [66,67]. We show that the ablation of\nGABAergic VD neurons induces ventrally directed movement\nlikely through the failure to properly relax the ventral muscles.\nConversely, ablation of GABAergic DD neurons induces dorsally\ndirected movement. Our experiments provide functional evidence\nthat VD and DD neurons inhibit ventral and dorsal bending.\nStrikingly, the acute inhibition or activation of the DD motor\nneurons     induces a      sharp    dorsal   or ventral     turn,   respectively.\nOptogenetic       neuronal      stimulation      can    elicit  distinct    motor\nresponses in multiple systems [47,68–70]. The optogenetic control\nof a single class of GABAergic neurons induces bi-directional\nsteering and the remote control of animal navigation.\n   The ventral omega turn in the escape response occurs several\nseconds after the touch-induced reversal, which is within the time\nscale that GPCRs modulate neuronal activity. To make a tight turn\nthe animal needs to generate an asymmetry in the excitation and\ninhibition of the ventral and dorsal muscle quadrants. Our data\nindicate that SER-2-mediated inhibition of GABAergic release onto\nthe ventral muscles stimulates ventral muscle contraction and the\nproper propagation of the ventral body bend during the omega turn\n(Figure 7B). The kinetics of synaptic activation of the ion channel\nLGC-55 and extrasynaptic activation of the G-protein coupled\nreceptor SER-2 temporally coordinates different phases of the escape\nresponse. Interestingly, the tyramine GPCR TYRA-3 modulates\nresponses to pain-like stimuli and decision making [27,62]. This\nindicates    that   tyramine,    much     like  the   mammalian        adrenergic\nsignaling, coordinates different aspects of a flight response.\n   Our results provide molecular and neural insights on how\nmonoamines         reconfigure     the    output    of   neural     circuits   and\norchestrate complex behaviors. Many neurotransmitters, including\nserotonin, GABA, acetylcholine, and glutamate, act through both\nion channels and GPCRs in animals ranging from worms to man.\nWe hypothesize that the temporally coordinated activation of\nionotropic     and     metabotropic       receptors    may     be    a   common\nsignaling motif employed across organisms to orchestrate behav-\nioral responses. Furthermore, the different monoamines appear to\nplay a strikingly conserved role in the specification of distinct\ninternal states, suggesting that the principles of neuronal modu-\nlation are conserved across species.\nMaterials and Methods\n\n   All C. elegans strains were grown at room temperature (22uC) on\nnematode growth media (NGM) agar plates with OP50 E. coli as a\nfood source [71].

Gentle touch to the head of C. elegans* elicits an escape response where the animal reverses its direction of locomotion while suppressing its exploratory head movements (II). Classic laser ablation experiments by Chalfie et al. (1985) [19] complemented by the known neural wiring diagram support a model in which the touch sensory neurons (ALM/AVM) inhibit the forward locomotion “command” neurons (PVC/AVB) and activate the backward locomotion “command” neurons (AVD/AVA), causing the animal to move backward away from the stimulus (Figure 7B). The AVA backward locomotion “command” neurons activate the electrically coupled tyraminergic RIM motor neurons, which exhibit coactivated calcium transients with the AVA [64,65]. Tyramine release from the RIM induces the suppression of head movements through the activation of the fast-acting inhibitory chloride channel, LGC-55, in neck muscles and cholinergic motor neurons that control head movements [13,22]. Activation of LGC-55 in the AVB forward locomotion “command” neurons further inhibits forward locomotion, stimulating long reversals that are coupled to the initiation of an omega turn [50,51]. The reversal is followed by a deep ventral head bend (III), allowing the animal to make a sharp (omega) turn (IV) where the head of the animal slides along the ventral side of the body and resumes forward locomotion (I). Our data show that extrasynaptic activation of the G-protein coupled tyramine receptor SER-2 contributes to the proper execution of the omega turn during the last stage of the escape response. The RIV and SMD head motor neurons have been implicated in the ventral head bend that initiates the omega turn [51]. ser-2 mutants properly initiate the turn but bend less deep and the head often fails to touch the tail during the omega turn (IV).\n\n*C. elegans* locomotion is controlled by cholinergic (A and B) and GABAergic (D) motor neurons that propel a wave of ventral-dorsal muscle flexures along the length of the body. We show that SER-2 inhibits neurotransmitter release from the GABAergic VD neurons. VD motor neurons release GABA on ventral body wall muscles and receive inputs from cholinergic DB neurons that synapse onto dorsal muscles. The DD motor neurons receive input from cholinergic VB motor neurons and release GABA on dorsal body wall muscles (Figure 4A) [20]. This organization indicates that GABAergic motor neurons are essential for contralateral muscle relaxation, thus promoting local bending during wave propagation [46].\n\nWhile spatial orientation in response to sensory stimuli is a fundamental component of animal behavior, the neural correlates are poorly understood. To change its direction of movement and navigate its environment, an animal needs to generate asymmetry in its locomotion pattern [66,67]. We show that the ablation of GABAergic VD neurons induces ventrally directed movement likely through the failure to properly relax the ventral muscles. Conversely, ablation of GABAergic DD neurons induces dorsally directed movement. Our experiments provide functional evidence that VD and DD neurons inhibit ventral and dorsal bending. Strikingly, the acute inhibition or activation of the DD motor neurons induces a sharp dorsal or ventral turn, respectively. Optogenetic neuronal stimulation can elicit distinct motor responses in multiple systems [47,68–70]. The optogenetic control of a single class of GABAergic neurons induces bi-directional steering and the remote control of animal navigation.\n\nThe ventral omega turn in the escape response occurs several seconds after the touch-induced reversal, which is within the time scale that GPCRs modulate neuronal activity. To make a tight turn the animal needs to generate an asymmetry in the excitation and inhibition of the ventral and dorsal muscle quadrants. Our data indicate that SER-2-mediated inhibition of GABAergic release onto the ventral muscles stimulates ventral muscle contraction and the proper propagation of the ventral body bend during the omega turn (Figure 7B). The kinetics of synaptic activation of the ion channel LGC-55 and extrasynaptic activation of the G-protein coupled receptor SER-2 temporally coordinates different phases of the escape response. Interestingly, the tyramine GPCR TYRA-3 modulates responses to pain-like stimuli and decision making [27,62]. This indicates that tyramine, much like the mammalian adrenergic signaling, coordinates different aspects of a flight response.\n\nOur results provide molecular and neural insights on how monoamines reconfigure the output of neural circuits and orchestrate complex behaviors. Many neurotransmitters, including serotonin, GABA, acetylcholine, and glutamate, act through both ion channels and GPCRs in animals ranging from worms to man. We hypothesize that the temporally coordinated activation of ionotropic and metabotropic receptors may be a common signaling motif employed across organisms to orchestrate behavioral responses. Furthermore, the different monoamines appear to play a strikingly conserved role in the specification of distinct internal states, suggesting that the principles of neuronal modulation are conserved across species.\n\n# Materials and Methods\n\nAll *C. elegans strains were grown at room temperature (22°C) on nematode growth media (NGM) agar plates with OP50 E. coli* as a food source [71].

The GABAergic and cholinergic cell-specific rescue lines\nwere cloned using ser-2a cDNA behind the unc-47 (1.2 kb) [72] and\nacr-2 (3.4 kb) promoters, respectively [73].\n   A Pmec-4::ChR2::YFP plasmid [47] was injected at 80 ng/ml.\nThe integrated strain was crossed into two                 ser-2  mutant allele\nbackgrounds.        Pflp-13::ChR2::GFP;          Pflp-13::NpHR::CFP           was\ncloned by inserting a 2 kb promoter from Pflp-13::GFP [37] into\nChR2 and NpHR vectors [47,48]. The integrated strains carrying\nChR2 or NpHR transgenes were cultured on NGM agar plates\n\ncontaining OP50         E. coli   supplemented with 1.3 mM all-trans-\nretinal for one generation. Larval L4 animals were transferred to\nretinal plates 24 h before behavioral assays.\n   Ventral nerve cord expression analysis was performed using\nPser-2::mCherry,       Punc-47::GFP,       and     Punc-17::GFP       transgenic\nanimals. Head muscle analysis was done using                   Pser-2::GFP    and\nPlgc-55::mCherry. Images were taken using confocal microscopy\n(Zeiss and Pascal imaging software) and formatted using ImageJ\nsoftware.\n\nBehavioral Assays\n   Behavioral assays were performed at room temperature. Drug\nassays were conducted on young adult animals aged 24 h post-L4\nlarval stage. Locomotion assays were performed on agar plates\ncontaining 2 mM acetic acid with or without tyramine hydro-\nchloride (Sigma-Aldrich). Approximately 10 animals were trans-\nferred to assay plates and scored for locomotion every minute over\na 20-minute period. Animals were scored as immobilized if there\nwas   no   sustained     forward     or  backward      locomotion       in  a  5-s\ninterval. Aldicarb drug assays were performed using NGM agar\nplates supplemented with 0.5 mM aldicarb (Sigma-Aldrich) with\nor without 30 mM tyramine. Locomotion is not obviously affected\non plates with 30 mM tyramine dissolved in NGM agar instead of\nthe agar used in exogenous tyramine paralysis assays. Animals\nwere scored as paralyzed when they did not move when prodded\nwith a platinum wire.\n   Optogenetic blue and green light-induced bending assays were\nperformed with        Pflp-13::ChR2::GFP;         Pflp-13::NpHR::CFP;          lite-\n1(ce314)    transgenic     animals.    Bending      behavior     movies,    worm\ntracking    traces,    and    kymographs        were    generated      using   the\nCoLBeRT worm tracking system as previously described [49].\nAnimals were placed in between two glass slides in 200 ml of NGM\ncontaining     30%     dextran.     The    space    between     the   slides   was\napproximately 0.127 mm and limited locomotion to two dimen-\nsions. The ventral nerve cord was illuminated with blue or green\nlight using the micromirror control of the CoLBeRT system, and\nthe behavior was analyzed using custom tracking software written\nin MATLAB. For assays used to calculate a bending index, young\nadult animals were transferred to NGM plates without food for\n45 min. Food deprivation stimulated long forward runs, which\nfacilitated the analysis of light-induced bending. Animals were\nexposed     to   blue    or   green    light,   using    GFP     (525 nm)      and\nRhodamine (550 nm) filters for 3 s. A dorsal or ventral bend\nwere scored if the bend was larger than 45u. The bending index\nwas calculated as the fraction of dorsally bending worms minus the\nfraction of ventrally bending worms. A positive fraction indicates a\ndorsal bias, a negative fraction indicates a ventral bias, and a zero\nvalue    represents    no    directional    bias   or  no    response    to   light\nexposures.\n   Omega       turns    were    analyzed      on    NGM       agar    plates   2 d\npostpouring to control for assay plate humidity. Assay plates\n(60 mm diameter) were seeded with 40 ml OP50 E. coli and grown\novernight at 37uC to produce a thin bacterial lawn. Young adult\nworms were transferred to an omega assay plate and allowed to\nacclimate for at least 10 min. Omega turns were induced by gentle\nanterior touch with fine eyebrow hair while recording using a\nFireWire       camera      and     Astro     IIDC      software.     For     Pmec-\n4::ChR2::YFP-induced omega turns, animals were exposed to\nblue    light  for   5 s  to   induce    a  reversal.    Bending     angles    and\nlocomotion trajectories were calculated using Image J software\nanalysis of movie stills. An omega turn was classified as a sharp\nturn larger than 90u from the initial trajectory, following a reversal\nof three or more body bends. The omega angle was measured\nusing the deepest part of the bend as the apex with vectors\nextending to the closest points along the body. Angles larger than\n60u were not scored. The escape angle was measured as the angle\nbetween the reversal trajectory and the trajectory of reinitiation of\nforward locomotion after the omega turn.\n\nLaser Ablations\n   Animals were mounted on agar pads and anesthetized with\n20 mM sodium azide. Laser ablations were done using standard\nmethods [74]. DD and VD motor neurons were identified in Pflp-\n13::GFP animals in the L2 larval stage and Pser-2::GFP animals in\nthe L3–L4 larval stage, respectively. Following a recovery period\nof 1 to 3 d postablation, locomotion and omega turn assays were\nconducted      on    young     adult   animals.     Locomotion       patterns    of\nanimals that exhibited coordinated long runs were recorded at\n7.5 fps.   Movie      analysis   was    done     using   MATLAB          and   the\nMATLAB          Image     Acquisition      Toolbox      [75].   To     determine\ndirectionality for each locomotion trace, the slope of instantaneous\ndirection    over    time   was    measured      for  individual     360   degree\nturning events. Laser ablation of motor neurons was confirmed by\nlack of GFP expression in the cell body positions in adult animals\nfollowing behavioral experiments.\n\nElectrophysiology\n   Endogenous postsynaptic currents were recorded from body\nwall muscles as previously described [43]. All electrophysiology\nexperiments were carried out at room temperature.

The bending index was calculated as the fraction of dorsally bending worms minus the fraction of ventrally bending worms. A positive fraction indicates a dorsal bias, a negative fraction indicates a ventral bias, and a zero value represents no directional bias or no response to light exposures.\n\nOmega turns were analyzed on NGM agar plates 2 d postpouring to control for assay plate humidity. Assay plates (60 mm diameter) were seeded with 40 ml OP50 E. coli and grown overnight at 37uC to produce a thin bacterial lawn. Young adult worms were transferred to an omega assay plate and allowed to acclimate for at least 10 min. Omega turns were induced by gentle anterior touch with fine eyebrow hair while recording using a FireWire camera and Astro IIDC software. For Pmec-4::ChR2::YFP-induced omega turns, animals were exposed to blue light for 5 s to induce a reversal. Bending angles and locomotion trajectories were calculated using Image J software analysis of movie stills. An omega turn was classified as a sharp turn larger than 90u from the initial trajectory, following a reversal of three or more body bends. The omega angle was measured using the deepest part of the bend as the apex with vectors extending to the closest points along the body. Angles larger than 60u were not scored. The escape angle was measured as the angle between the reversal trajectory and the trajectory of reinitiation of forward locomotion after the omega turn.",

The preparation was then washed briefly for ,20 s with a solution of collagenase type IV from *Clostridium hystolyticum* (Sigma-Aldrich) in extracellular bath solution (at a concentration of 1 mg/ml) in order to remove the basement membrane overlying the muscles.\n\nThe extracellular solution consisted of 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 15 mM HEPES, and 10 mM glucose (pH 7.4, osmolarity adjusted with 20 mM sucrose). The intracellular fluid (ICF) consisted of 25 mM K-gluconate, 115 mM KCl, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 50 mM HEPES, 5 mM Mg-ATP, 0.5 mM Na-GTP, 0.5 mM cGMP, 0.5 mM cAMP, and 1 mM BAPTA (pH 7.4, osmolarity adjusted with 10 mM sucrose). Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings from *C. elegans* body wall muscle cells (group of ventral medial muscles 9, 11, 13) from +/+ and ser-2 mutant strains were performed as previously described [43] using an EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA). Data acquisition and voltage protocols were controlled by HEKA Patchmaster software. Patch-clamp electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass with filament (Sutter Instrument), fire-polished to a resistance of 4–6 MV, and filled with an internal solution. 1 M KCl electrode with agarose bridge served as reference electrode. Leak currents and liquid junction potentials were not compensated, though pipette offset was zeroed immediately before getting a gigaohm seal. The membrane potential was clamped at 260 mV. Data were digitized at 6.67 kHz and low pass filtered at 3.3 kHz. Membrane capacitance and the series resistance (at least 20%, up to 60%) were compensated, and only recordings in which the series resistance was stable throughout the course of the recording were included. Endogenous synaptic activity data were collected in continuous mode (saved as 30-s recording sweeps). Typically, 60–90 s of control endogenous activity was recorded followed by a 90-s bath tyramine application (100 mM), and subsequent tyramine wash-out (occasional). The muscle preparation was continuously perfused by extracellular solution with or without tyramine by gravity-flow at a perfusion rate of 2 ml/min. Cells were excluded from analysis if a leak current .300 pA was observed. Only recordings with series resistance R,15 MV were included in the analysis. Data analysis and graphing were performed using Excel (Microsoft), Igor Pro (WaveMetrics Inc.), and GraphPrism (GraphPad Software). Mini Analysis software (Synaptosoft Inc.) was used to detect and analyze the endogenous events off-line. Parameters for detection of events were set as follows: amplitude threshold 12 pA, period to search local minimum 80 ms, time before a peak for baseline 20 ms, period to search a decay time 30 ms, fraction of peak to find a decay time 0.37, period to average a baseline 10 ms, area threshold 10, and number of points to average for peak 3. In addition, following automatic detection of endogenous postsynaptic currents, traces were visually inspected, and all events were manually verified and accepted/rejected or recalculated, if necessary. Sixty seconds of continuous data were used in analysis. Segments of 60-s recording prior to tyramine application served as a control. The tyramine effect was evaluated in the last 60 s of a 90-s perfusion—that is, initial 30 s of recording with tyramine in bath solution were eliminated from analysis in order to allow enough time for adequate tyramine perfusion and stabilization effect. Data from each group were averaged, and statistical significance between the strains was determined by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.",
