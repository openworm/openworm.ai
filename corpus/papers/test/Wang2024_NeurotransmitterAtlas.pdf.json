Efforts to map these neurotransmitter\n                         systems to individual cell types throughout the entire nervous system have a long history, beginning\n                         with the use of chemical stains that directly detected a given neurotransmitter (dopamine) (Sulston\n                         et  al., 1975), followed by antibody staining of neurotransmitter themselves (serotonin and GABA)\n                         (Horvitz et al., 1982; McIntire et al., 1993) or antibody stains of biosynthetic enzymes or neurotrans-\n                         mitter vesicular transporters (acetylcholine and monoamines) (Loer and Kenyon, 1993; Duerr et al.,\n                         1999; Duerr et al., 2001; Alkema et al., 2005; Duerr et al., 2008; see Figure 1A for an overview of\n                         these enzymes and transporters).\n                         While these early approaches proved successful in revealing neurotransmitter identities, they\n                         displayed several technical limitations. Since neurotransmitter- synthesizing or -transporting proteins\n                         primarily localize to neurites, the cellular identity of expressing cells (usually determined by assessing\n                         cell body position) often could not be unambiguously established in several, particularly cell- and\n                         neurite-dense regions of the nervous system. One example concerns cholinergic neurons, which are\n                         deﬁned by the expression of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter UNC-\n                                                                                               17/VAChT and choline acet-\n                         yltransferase CHA-1/ChAT.

In addition, for GABA-  producing neurons, it became\n                         apparent that antibody-based GABA detection was dependent on staining protocols, leading to the\n                         identiﬁcation of ‘novel’ anti- GABA-positive neurons, i.e., GABAergic neurons, more than 20  years\n                         after the initial description of GABAergic neurons (McIntire et al., 1993; Gendrel et al., 2016).\n                         An alternative approach to mapping neurotransmitter usage has been the use of reporter trans-\n                         genes. This approach has the signiﬁcant advantage of allowing the ﬂuorophore to either ﬁll the\n                         entire cytoplasm of a cell or to be targeted to the nucleus, thereby facilitating neuron identiﬁcation.\n                         However, one shortcoming of transgene-\n                                                                               based reporter approaches is that one cannot be certain that\n                         a chosen genomic region, fused to a reporter gene, indeed contains all cis-\n                                                                                                 regulatory elements of the\n                         respective locus.

The introduction of\n                         fosmid-based reporter transgenes has largely addressed such concerns, as these reporters, with their\n                         30–50 Kb size, usually cover entire intergenic regions (Sarov et al., 2012).

Efforts to map these neurotransmitter systems to individual cell types throughout the entire nervous system have a long history, beginning with the use of chemical stains that directly detected a given neurotransmitter (dopamine) (**Sulston et al., 1975**), followed by antibody staining of neurotransmitter themselves (serotonin and GABA) (**Horvitz et al., 1982; McIntire et al., 1993**) or antibody stains of biosynthetic enzymes or neurotransmitter vesicular transporters (acetylcholine and monoamines) (**Loer and Kenyon, 1993; Duerr et al., 1999; Duerr et al., 2001; Alkema et al., 2005; Duerr et al., 2008; see Figure 1A** for an overview of these enzymes and transporters).\n\nWhile these early approaches proved successful in revealing neurotransmitter identities, they displayed several technical limitations. Since neurotransmitter-synthesizing or -transporting proteins primarily localize to neurites, the cellular identity of expressing cells (usually determined by assessing cell body position) often could not be unambiguously established in several, particularly cell- and neurite-dense regions of the nervous system. One example concerns cholinergic neurons, which are defined by the expression of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter UNC-17/VAChT and choline acetyltransferase CHA-1/ChAT. While mainly neurite-localized UNC-17 and CHA-1 antibody staining experiments could identify a subset of cholinergic neurons (**Duerr et al., 2001; Duerr et al., 2008**), many remained unidentified (**Pereira et al., 2015**). In addition, for GABA-producing neurons, it became apparent that antibody-based GABA detection was dependent on staining protocols, leading to the identification of ‘novel’ anti-GABA-positive neurons, i.e., GABAergic neurons, more than 20 years after the initial description of GABAergic neurons (**McIntire et al., 1993; Gendrel et al., 2016**).\n\nAn alternative approach to mapping neurotransmitter usage has been the use of reporter transgenes. This approach has the significant advantage of allowing the fluorophore to either fill the entire cytoplasm of a cell or to be targeted to the nucleus, thereby facilitating neuron identification. However, one shortcoming of transgene-based reporter approaches is that one cannot be certain that a chosen genomic region, fused to a reporter gene, indeed contains all *cis*-regulatory elements of the respective locus. In fact, the first report that described the expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter EAT-4, the key marker for glutamatergic neuron identity, largely underestimated the number of *eat-4/VLGUT*-positive and, hence, glutamatergic neurons (**Lee et al., 1999**).

Additional neurons that we classify as GABAergic are those that do not synthesize GABA (*unc-25/GAD*-negative), but take up GABA from other neurons (based on anti-GABA antibody staining) and are expected to release GABA based on *unc-47/VGAT* expression (*Gendrel et al., 2016*). *unc-47/VGAT* expression without any evidence of GABA synthesis or uptake (*unc-25/GAD*- and anti-GABA-negative) is indicative of an unknown transmitter being present in these cells and utilizing *unc-47/VGAT* for vesicular secretion.\n\nd. **tph-1/TPH and bas-1/AAAD**: the co-expression of these two biosynthetic enzymes, together with the co-expression of the monoamine vesicular transporter *cat-1/VMAT*, defines all serotonin-synthesizing and -releasing neurons (*Figure 1A; Horvitz et al., 1982; Duerr et al., 1999; Sze et al., 2000; Hare and Loer, 2004*).\n\ne. **cat-2/TH and bas-1/AAAD**: the co-expression of these two biosynthetic enzymes, together with the co-expression of the monoamine vesicular transporter *cat-1/VMAT*, defines all dopamine-synthesizing and -releasing neurons (*Figure 1A; Sulston et al., 1975; Duerr et al., 1999; Lints and Emmons, 1999; Hare and Loer, 2004*).\n\nf. **tdc-1/TDC**: defines, together with *cat-1/VMAT*, all tyramine-synthesizing and -releasing neurons (*Figure 1A; Alkema et al., 2005*).\n\ng. **tbh-1/TBH**: expression of this gene, in combination with that of *tdc-1/TDC* and *cat-1/VMAT*, defines octopamine-synthesizing and -releasing neurons (*Figure 1A; Alkema et al., 2005*).\n\nh. **cat-1/VMAT**: expression of this vesicular monoamine transporter defines all four abovementioned monoaminergic neurons (serotonin, dopamine, tyramine, octopamine) (*Duerr et al., 1999*), but as described and discussed below, it may also define additional sets of monoaminergic neurons.\n\ni. **hdl-1/AAAD**: *hdl-1*, a previously uncharacterized gene, encodes the only other AAAD with sequence similarity to the *bas-1* and *tdc-1* AAAD enzymes that produce other bona fide\n","images":[{"name":"page_4.jpg","height":792,"width":612,"x":0,"y":0,"original_width":2473,"original_height":3200,"type":"full_page_screenshot"}],"charts":[],"items":[{"type":"text","value":"system of L4 stage animals by the CeNGEN consortium (Taylor et al., 2021).

Our analysis provides insights into the breadth of usage of each individual neurotransmitter system, reveals instances of co-transmitter use, indicates the existence of neurons that may entirely rely on neuropeptides instead of classic neurotransmitters, reveals sexual dimorphisms in neurotransmitter usage, and suggests the likely existence of presently unknown neurotransmitters.","bBox":{"x":168.53,"y":63.99,"w":406,"h":343.47}},{"type":"heading","lvl":2,"value":"Results","md":"## Results  ","bBox":{"x":168.53,"y":263.48,"w":47,"h":14}},{"type":"heading","lvl":3,"value":"Comparing CeNGEN scRNA data to reporter gene data","md":"### Comparing CeNGEN scRNA data to reporter gene data  ","bBox":{"x":168.53,"y":280.48,"w":316,"h":12}},{"type":"text","value":"To investigate the neurotransmitter identity of neurons throughout the entire *C. elegans* nervous system of both sexes, we consider here the expression pattern of the following 15 genetic loci (see also *Figure 1A*):\n\na. **eat-4/VGLUT**: expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter is alone sufficient to define glutamatergic neuron identity (*Lee et al., 1999; Serrano-Saiz et al., 2013*).\n\nb. **unc-17/VAChT**: expression of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter, located in an operon together with the acetylcholine-synthesizing gene *cha-1/ChAT* (*Alfonso et al., 1994*), defines cholinergic neurons (*Duerr et al., 2001; Duerr et al., 2008; Pereira et al., 2015*).\n\nc. **unc-25/GAD, unc-47/VGAT, and its sorting co-factor unc-46/LAMP**: expression of these three genes defines neurons that synthesize and release GABA (*McIntire et al., 1993; McIntire et al., 1997; Jin et al., 1999; Schuske et al., 2007; Gendrel et al., 2016*).

For *unc-46, unc-47, tph-1, bas-1, tbh-1, cat-1, cat-2, snf-3,* and *oct-1*, we knocked-in a `sl2::gfp::h2b` cassette at the C-terminus of the locus. The SL2 sequence also provides for the separate production of GFP::H2B. Both types of reporter cassettes should capture posttranscriptional, 3’UTR-mediated regulation of each locus, e.g., by miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (not captured by CeNGEN scRNA data). Since in each case the reporter is targeted to the nucleus, this strategy circumvents shortcomings associated with interpreting antibody staining patterns or dealing with too densely packed cytosolic signals. For *mod-5*, we analyzed a previously generated, non-nuclear reporter allele (Maicas et al., 2021). For all our neuronal cell identification, we utilized the neuronal landmark strain NeuroPAL (Tekieli et al., 2021; Yemini et al., 2021). The results of our neuronal expression pattern analysis are summarized in *Figure 3* and detailed in *Supplementary files 2 and 3*. In the ensuing sections we describe these patterns in detail.","md":"monoamines (*Figure 1—figure supplement 1*; Hare and Loer, 2004). *hdl-1* expression may therefore, in combination with *cat-1/VMAT*, identify neurons that produce and release trace amines of unknown identity.\n\nj. **snf-3/BGT1/SLC6A12**: this gene encodes the functionally validated ortholog of the vertebrate betaine uptake transporter SLC6A12 (i.e. BGT1) (Peden et al., 2013). In combination with the expression of *cat-1/VMAT*, which synaptically transports betaine (Hardege et al., 2022), *snf-3* expression may identify neurons that utilize betaine as a synaptically released neurotransmitter to gate betaine-gated ion channels, such as ACR-23 (Peden et al., 2013) or LGC-41 (Hardege et al., 2022).\n\nk. **mod-5/SERT**: this gene codes for the functionally validated ortholog of the vertebrate serotonin uptake transporter SERT (Ranganathan et al., 2001), which defines neurons that take up serotonin independently of their ability to synthesize serotonin and, depending on their expression of *cat-1/VMAT*, may either re-utilize serotonin for synaptic signaling or serve as serotonin clearance neurons.\n\nl. **oct-1/OCT**: this gene encodes the closest representative of the OCT subclass of SLC22 organic cation transporters (Zhu et al., 2015), several members of which are selective uptake transporters of tyramine (Breidert et al., 1998; Berry et al., 2016). Its expression or function in the nervous system had not previously been analyzed in *C. elegans*.\n\nFor all these 15 genetic loci, we compared scRNA transcriptome data from the CeNGEN scRNA atlas (at all four available stringency levels; Taylor et al., 2021) to previously published reporter and antibody staining data. As shown in *Figure 1B* and *Supplementary file 1*, such comparisons reveal the following:  \n- (a) scRNA data support the expression of genes in the vast majority of neurons in which those genes were found to be expressed with previous reporter gene approaches. In most cases, this is true even at the highest threshold levels for scRNA detection.  \n- (b) Vice versa, reporter gene expression supports scRNA transcriptome data for a specific neurotransmitter system in the great majority of cells.  \n- (c) In spite of this congruence, there were several discrepancies between reporter data and scRNA data. Generally, while valuable, scRNA transcriptome data cannot be considered the final word for any gene expression pattern assignments. Lack of detection of transcripts could be a sensitivity issue and, conversely, the presence of transcripts does not necessarily indicate that the respective protein is generated, due to the possibility of posttranscriptional regulation.\n\nHence, to consolidate and further improve neurotransmitter identity assignment throughout the entire *C. elegans* nervous system, and to circumvent potential limitations of multicopy, fosmid-based reporter transgenes on which previous neurotransmitter assignments have been based, we engineered and examined expression patterns of 16 knock-in reporter alleles of the 15 neurotransmitter synthesis, vesicular transport, and uptake loci listed above (*Figure 1, Figure 2*). For *unc-17* and *eat-4*, we knocked-in a `t2a::gfp::h2b (his-44)` cassette right before the stop codon of the respective gene. For *unc-25*, we created two knock-in alleles with the `t2a::gfp::h2b (his-44)` cassette tagging isoforms a.1/c.1 and b.1 separately. For *tdc-1*, a `gfp::h2b::t2a` cassette was knocked into the N-terminus of the locus because of different C-terminal splice variants. The self-cleaving T2A peptide frees up GFP::H2B, which will be transported to the nucleus, thereby facilitating cell identification. For *unc-46, unc-47, tph-1, bas-1, tbh-1, cat-1, cat-2, snf-3,* and *oct-1*, we knocked-in a `sl2::gfp::h2b` cassette at the C-terminus of the locus. The SL2 sequence also provides for the separate production of GFP::H2B. Both types of reporter cassettes should capture posttranscriptional, 3’UTR-mediated regulation of each locus, e.g., by miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (not captured by CeNGEN scRNA data).

However, scRNA transcripts were detected at all four threshold\n                         levels in three additional neuron classes, RIC, PVN, and DVA, for which no previous reporter data\n                         provided support. In a recent publication, we had already described that the eat- 4 reporter allele\n                         syb4257 is expressed in RIC (Reilly et  al., 2022) (conﬁrmed in   Figure  4A). We now also conﬁrm\n                         expression of this reporter allele, albeit at low levels, in DVA and PVN (Figure 4B,   Supplementary\n                         file 2).\n                         Another neuron found to have some eat- 4 transcripts, but only with the two lower threshold sets,\n                         is the I6 pharyngeal neuron. Consistent with our previous fosmid- based reporter data, we detected\n                         no I6 expression with our eat- 4(syb4257) reporter allele. The eat- 4 reporter allele also shows expres-\n                         sion in the pharyngeal neuron M5, albeit very weakly (Figure 4A, Supplementary file 2), consistent\n                         with CeNGEN scRNA data. Weak expression of the eat- 4 fosmid-     based reporter in ASK and ADL\n                         remained weak, but clearly detectable with the eat- 4(syb4257) reporter allele (Figure  4A,   Supple-\n                         mentary file 2). Extremely dim expression in PHA can be occasionally detected. Whereas the PVQ\n                         neuron class displays eat- 4 scRNA transcripts and was reported to show very dim eat- 4 fosmid- based\n                         reporter expression, we detected no expression of the eat- 4(syb4257) reporter allele in PVQ neurons\n                         (Figure  4B, Supplementary file 2). We also did not detect expression of      eat- 4(syb4257) in the\n                         GABAergic AVL and DVB neurons, in which a recent report describes expression of an eat- 4 promoter\n                         fusion reporter (Li et  al., 2023). An absence of eat- 4(syb4257) expression in AVL and DVB is also\n                         consistent with the absence of scRNA transcripts in these neurons.\n                         A few neurons were found to express eat- 4 transcripts by the CeNGEN atlas, but only with lower\n                         threshold levels, including, for example, the RMD, PVM, and I4 neurons (Figure  1B,     Supplemen-\n                         tary file 1). We failed to detect reporter allele expression in RMD or PVM neurons, but occasionally\n                         observed very dim expression in I4. Lastly, we identiﬁed a novel site of eat- 4 expression in the dopa-\n                         minergic PDE neuron (Figure 4B, Supplementary file 2). While such expression was neither detected\n                         with previous reporters nor scRNA transcripts, we detected it very consistently but at relatively low\n                         levels.\n\n                         Expression of a reporter allele of unc-17/VAChT, a marker for\n                         cholinergic identity, in the hermaphrodite\n                         41 of previously described 52 neuron classes that show unc- 17 fosmid-  based reporter expression\n                         (Pereira et al., 2015) showed transcripts in the CeNGEN scRNA atlas at four out of four threshold\n                         levels, another seven neuron classes at three out of four threshold levels, and one at the lowest\n                         two threshold levels (Taylor et al., 2021).

However, scRNA transcripts were detected at all four threshold levels in three additional neuron classes, RIC, PVN, and DVA, for which no previous reporter data provided support. In a recent publication, we had already described that the *eat-4* reporter allele syb4257 is expressed in RIC (*Reilly et al., 2022*) (confirmed in *Figure 4A*). We now also confirm expression of this reporter allele, albeit at low levels, in DVA and PVN (*Figure 4B, Supplementary file 2*).  \n\nAnother neuron found to have some *eat-4* transcripts, but only with the two lower threshold sets, is the I6 pharyngeal neuron.

The *eat-4* reporter allele also shows expression in the pharyngeal neuron M5, albeit very weakly (*Figure 4A, Supplementary file 2*), consistent with CeNGEN scRNA data.

We also did not detect expression of *eat-4(syb4257)* in the GABAergic AVL and DVB neurons, in which a recent report describes expression of an *eat-4* promoter fusion reporter (*Li et al., 2023*). An absence of *eat-4(syb4257)* expression in AVL and DVB is also consistent with the absence of scRNA transcripts in these neurons.  \n\nA few neurons were found to express *eat-4* transcripts by the CeNGEN atlas, but only with lower threshold levels, including, for example, the RMD, PVM, and I4 neurons (*Figure 1B, Supplementary file 1*).

(B) Previously uncharacterized eat‐ 4\n                         expression in PDE and DVA neurons is detected with the eat‐ 4(syb4257) reporter allele.

Expression in PVN is detected in both\n                         sexes but at a much higher level in the male.

There is no visible expression in RIB, FLP, or AVJ.\n                         Consistent with previous reports, AIM expresses unc‐ 17 only in males and not hermaphrodites. In addition, very\n                         dim expression of AVG can be detected occasionally in hermaphrodites (representative image showing an animal\n                         with no visible expression) and slightly stronger in males (representative image showing an animal with visible\n                         expression).

Scale bars, 10 μm in color\n                         images in A, C, and D; 5 μm in B and all grayscale images. Quantiﬁcation in B is done by normalizing fluorescent\n                         intensity of eat‐ 4 GFP to that of the blue channel in the NeuroPAL background. Statistics, Mann-\n                                                                                                         Whitney test.\n\n                         expression (Taylor et al., 2021). The unc- 17(syb4491) reporter allele conﬁrmed weak but consistent\n                         expression in the PVN neurons as well as variable, borderline expression in AVG (Figure 4C and D).\n                         However, we failed to detect unc- 17(syb4491) reporter allele expression in the RIB neurons.\n                         We detected another novel site of unc- 17 expression, albeit dim, in the glutamatergic AFD neurons\n                         (Figure  4C, Supplementary file 2).

To investigate this matter further, we CRISPR/\n                         Cas9- engineered  a\n                                    gfp-based reporter allele for unc- 47,\n                                                                               syb7566, and ﬁrst crossed it with an mCherry-\n                         based unc- 47 fosmid-\n                                             based reporter (otIs564) as a ﬁrst-pass assessment for any obvious overlaps and\n                         mismatches of expression patterns between the two (Figure 5B, left side panels). The vast majority\n                         of neurons exhibited overlapping expression between   syb7566 and otIs564.

In a few cases where the fosmid-based reporter expression was so dim\n                         that it is only detectable via antibody staining against its ﬂuorophore (mCherry) (Gendrel et al., 2016;\n                         Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b), the reporter allele expression was readily visible (Supplementary file 1).\n                         The very few mismatches of expression of the fosmid-      based reporter and the reporter allele\n                         included the pharyngeal neuron M1, which expresses no visible unc- 47(syb7566) reporter allele but\n                         weak fosmid-based reporter expression, and the pharyngeal neuron I1, which expresses dim syb7566\n                         but no fosmid- based reporter (Figure 5B, right side panels). AVJ shows very dim and variable unc-\n                         47(syb7566) reporter allele expression but no fosmid- based reporter expression. Since AVJ stains\n                         with anti-GABA antibodies (Gendrel et  al., 2016), this neuron likely engages in vesicular relase of\n                         GABA, even though its source of GABA remains unclear since it neither expresses conventional GABA\n                         synthesis machinery (UNC-25/GAD) nor GABA uptake machinery (SNF-11).

This suggests that UNC-    47/VGAT may transport another unidentiﬁed\n                         neurotransmitter (see Discussion) (Gendrel et al., 2016).\n\n                         Expression of unc‐46/LAMP\n                         In all GABA-synthesizing neurons, the UNC-47/VGAT protein requires the LAMP-like protein UNC-46\n                         for proper localization (Schuske et al., 2007).

In the head, consistent with previous reports of the unc-47 fosmid-based reporter (otIs564), dim expression of *unc-47*(syb7566) in SMD, ALA, and very dim and variable expression in IL1 is detected in both sexes, and *unc-47*(syb7566) is expressed in ADF only in the male and not hermaphrodite. In addition, the reporter allele is also expressed at a very dim level in the pharyngeal neuron I1 (also in inset) whereas no expression is detected in M1.

However, we did not observe any discernible fluorescent reporter expression from this allele. Hence, it is unlikely that an alternative isoform could contribute to expression in additional cell types.\n\n## Expression of *unc-47/VGAT*\n\nWhile promoter-based transgenes for the vesicular transporter for GABA, *unc-47/VGAT*, had shown expression patterns that precisely match that of *unc-25/GAD* (*Eastman et al., 1999*), we had noted in our previous analysis of the GABA system that a fosmid-based reporter showed much broader expression in many additional neuron classes that showed no sign of GABA usage (*Gendrel et al., 2016*). In several of these neuron classes both the fosmid-based reporter and the CeNGEN scRNA data indicate very robust expression (e.g. AIN, SIA, SDQ), while in many others scRNA transcripts are only evident at looser thresholds and, correspondingly, fosmid-based reporter expression in these cells is often weak (*Supplementary file 1; Gendrel et al., 2016*). To investigate this matter further, we CRISPR/Cas9-engineered a *gfp*-based reporter allele for *unc-47*, syb7566, and first crossed it with an mCherry-based *unc-47* fosmid-based reporter (otIs564) as a first-pass assessment for any obvious overlaps and mismatches of expression patterns between the two (Figure 5B, left side panels). The vast majority of neurons exhibited overlapping expression between syb7566 and otIs564. There were also many notable similarities in the robustness of expression of the fosmid-based reporter and the reporter allele (*Supplementary file 1*). In a few cases where the fosmid-based reporter expression was so dim that it is only detectable via antibody staining against its fluorophore (mCherry) (*Gendrel et al., 2016; Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b*), the reporter allele expression was readily visible (*Supplementary file 1*).\n\nThe very few mismatches of expression of the fosmid-based reporter and the reporter allele included the pharyngeal neuron M1, which expresses no visible *unc-47*(syb7566) reporter allele but weak fosmid-based reporter expression, and the pharyngeal neuron I1, which expresses dim syb7566 but no fosmid-based reporter (Figure 5B, right side panels).

In addition to these well-characterized sites of expression, several of the individual genes show scRNA-based transcripts in a few additional cells: *tph-1* at all four threshold levels in AFD and MI. Neither of these cells display scRNA transcripts for *bas-1/AAAD*, the enzyme that metabolizes the TPH-1 product 5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) into serotonin (5-HT) (*Figure 1A*). To further investigate these observations, we generated reporter alleles for both *tph-1* and *bas-1* (*Figure 2*). Expression of the *tph-1* reporter allele *syb6451* confirmed expression in the previously well-described neurons that stained positive for serotonin, namely NSM, HSN, and ADF, matching CeNGEN data. While expression in AFD (seen at all four threshold levels in the CeNGEN scRNA atlas) could not be confirmed with the reporter allele, expression in the pharyngeal MI neurons could be confirmed (*Figure 6A, Figure 6—figure supplement 1, Supplementary file 2*).\n\nWe detected co-expression of the *bas-1* reporter allele, *syb5923*, with *tph-1(syb6451)* in NSM, HSN, and ADF, in accordance with the previous reporter and scRNA data (*Figure 6B, Supplementary file 2*). However, *bas-1(syb5923)* is not co-expressed with *tph-1* in MI (*Figure 6A and B*), nor is there CeNGEN-transcript evidence for *bas-1/AAAD* in MI (*Figure 1, Supplementary file 1*). Hence, TPH-1-synthesized 5-HTP in MI is not metabolized into 5-HT (serotonin), consistent with the lack of serotonin-antibody staining in MI (*Horvitz et al., 1982; Sze et al., 2000*).\n\nWe also detected *tph-1(syb6451)* reporter allele expression in the serotonergic VC4 and VC5 neurons (*Figure 6A, Supplementary file 2*), consistent with scRNA data (*Figure 1, Supplementary file 1*) and previous reporter transgene data (*Mondal et al., 2018*). This suggests that these neurons are capable of producing 5-HTP. However, there is no *bas-1(syb5923)* expression in VC4 or VC5, consistent with previous data showing that serotonin is taken up, but not synthesized by them (*Duerr et al., 2001*) (more below on monoamine uptake; *Tables 1 and 2*).\n\nAs expected from the role of *bas-1/AAAD* in dopamine synthesis (*Hare and Loer, 2004*), *bas-1(syb5923)* is also expressed in dopaminergic neurons PDE, CEP, and ADE. In addition, it is also expressed weakly in URB, consistent with scRNA data. We did not detect visible expression in PVW or PVT, both of which showed very low levels of scRNA transcripts (*Figure 1, Supplementary file 1*). Expression of *bas-1/AAAD* in URB may suggest that URB generates a non-canonical monoamine (e.g. tryptamine, phenylethylamine [PEA], or histamine), but since URB expresses no vesicular transporter (*cat-1/VMAT*, see below), we consider it unlikely that any such monoamine would be secreted via canonical vesicular synaptic release mechanisms.\n\n## Expression of a reporter allele of *cat-2/TH*, a dopaminergic marker, in the hermaphrodite\n\nThe CeNGEN scRNA atlas shows transcripts for the rate-limiting enzyme of dopamine synthesis encoded by *cat-2/TH* (*Figure 1B, Supplementary file 1*) at all four threshold levels in all three previously described dopaminergic neuron classes in the hermaphrodite, ADE, PDE, and CEP (*Sulston et al., 1975; Sulston et al., 1980; Lints and Emmons, 1999*). At lower threshold levels, transcripts can also be detected in the OLL neurons.

This matched the observations that RIH and AIM do not synthesize serotonin (i.e. do not\nexpress tph- 1), but stain positive with a serotonin antibody (Jafari et al., 2011). In mod- 5 mutants or\nwild type worms treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (such as the SSRI ﬂuoxetine), RIH and AIM\nlose serotonin immunoreactivity (Jafari et  al., 2011). We analyzed a CRISPR-     based reporter allele,\nmod- 5(vlc47) (Maicas et al., 2021), and conﬁrmed expression in the four neuron classes NSM, ADF,\nRIH, and AIM (Figure 8). Because only NSM, ADF, and RIH, but not AIM, express the reporter allele\nof the monoamine transporter CAT- 1/VMAT (Figure  6), AIM likely functions as a serotonin uptake/\nclearance neuron (Tables  1 and 2; see also Discussion). In addition, we also detected dim mod- 5/\nSERT expression in the phasmid neuron class PHA and very dim, variable signals in URX (Figure 8A,\nB, E) consistent with scRNA data (Supplementary file 1). The results for anti-                                 serotonin-staining\nfrom previous reports are variable in a few neurons, possibly due to differences in staining methods\n(including URX, I5, VC4, VC5, and PVW                                          Loer and Kenyon, 1993; Rand and Nonet, 1997; Duerr\net al., 1999; Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b). In light of its mod- 5/SERT reporter expression, URX may\nacquire serotonin via mod- 5, akin to AIM (Tables 1 and 2).\nIn the hermaphrodite- speciﬁc neurons HSN, VC4, and VC5, we did not observe expression of\nthe mod- 5/SERT reporter allele (Tables 1 and 2). Since VC4 and VC5 do not express the complete\nsynthesis pathway for serotonin, we infer that the anti-                       serotonin staining in these neurons is a\nresult of alternative serotonin uptake or synthesis mechanisms. A similar scenario holds for the\npharyngeal neuron I5, which was previously reported to stain weakly for serotonin (Serrano- Saiz\net al., 2017b).\n\nTyramine uptake\nBiochemical studies in vertebrates have shown that the SLC22A1/2/3 (aka OCT- 1/2/3) organic cation\ntransporters can uptake monoaminergic neurotransmitters (Nigam, 2018), with SLC22A2 being\napparently selective for tyramine (Berry et  al., 2016).                       oct- 1 is the ortholog of the OCT subclass\nof SLC22 family members (Zhu et al., 2015), but neither its expression nor function in the nervous\nsystem had been previously reported. We tagged the endogenous oct- 1 locus with an sl2::gfp::h2b\ncassette (syb8870) and, within the nervous system, observed exclusive expression in the RIM neuron\n(Figure 8H and I), indicating that RIM is likely capable of uptaking tyramine in addition to synthesizing\nit via tdc- 1/TDC. This is consistent with RIM being the only neuron showing oct- 1 scRNA transcripts at\nall four threshold levels in the CeNGEN atlas (Supplementary file 1).\n\nWang et al. eLife 2024;13:RP95402.

This matched the observations that RIH and AIM do not synthesize serotonin (i.e. do not express *tph-1*), but stain positive with a serotonin antibody (Jafari et al., 2011). In *mod-5* mutants or wild type worms treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (such as the SSRI fluoxetine), RIH and AIM lose serotonin immunoreactivity (Jafari et al., 2011). We analyzed a CRISPR-based reporter allele, *mod-5(vlc47)* (Maicas et al., 2021), and confirmed expression in the four neuron classes NSM, ADF, RIH, and AIM (Figure 8). Because only NSM, ADF, and RIH, but not AIM, express the reporter allele of the monoamine transporter *CAT-1/VMAT* (Figure 6), AIM likely functions as a serotonin uptake/clearance neuron (Tables 1 and 2; see also Discussion). In addition, we also detected dim *mod-5/SERT* expression in the phasmid neuron class PHA and very dim, variable signals in URX (Figure 8A, B, E) consistent with scRNA data (Supplementary file 1). The results for anti-serotonin-staining from previous reports are variable in a few neurons, possibly due to differences in staining methods (including URX, I5, VC4, VC5, and PVW; Loer and Kenyon, 1993; Rand and Nonet, 1997; Duerr et al., 1999; Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b). In light of its *mod-5/SERT* reporter expression, URX may acquire serotonin via *mod-5*, akin to AIM (Tables 1 and 2).\n\nIn the hermaphrodite-specific neurons HSN, VC4, and VC5, we did not observe expression of the *mod-5/SERT* reporter allele (Tables 1 and 2). Since VC4 and VC5 do not express the complete synthesis pathway for serotonin, we infer that the anti-serotonin staining in these neurons is a result of alternative serotonin uptake or synthesis mechanisms. A similar scenario holds for the pharyngeal neuron I5, which was previously reported to stain weakly for serotonin (Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b).\n\n## Tyramine uptake\n\nBiochemical studies in vertebrates have shown that the SLC22A1/2/3 (aka OCT-1/2/3) organic cation transporters can uptake monoaminergic neurotransmitters (Nigam, 2018), with SLC22A2 being apparently selective for tyramine (Berry et al., 2016). *oct-1* is the ortholog of the OCT subclass of SLC22 family members (Zhu et al., 2015), but neither its expression nor function in the nervous system had been previously reported. We tagged the endogenous *oct-1* locus with an `sl2::gfp::h2b` cassette (syb8870) and, within the nervous system, observed exclusive expression in the RIM neuron (Figure 8H and I), indicating that RIM is likely capable of uptaking tyramine in addition to synthesizing it via *tdc-1/TDC*. This is consistent with RIM being the only neuron showing *oct-1* scRNA transcripts at all four threshold levels in the CeNGEN atlas (Supplementary file 1).\n","images":[{"name":"page_19.jpg","height":792,"width":612,"x":0,"y":0,"original_width":2473,"original_height":3200,"type":"full_page_screenshot"}],"charts":[],"items":[{"type":"heading","lvl":1,"value":"Table 2 continued","md":"# Table 2 continued","bBox":{"x":36.5,"y":51.8,"w":71,"h":9}},{"type":"table","rows":[["Synthesis (and/or uptake)","cat-1","tph-1","cat-2","bas-1","tdc-1","tbh-1","mod-5","snf-3","oct-1","Direct staining","Sex-specific neurons","Sex-shared neurons"],["Unknown monoamine?","+","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","","PVX, PVY","AVL*"],["Unknown monoamine?","-","-","-","-","-","+","-","-","-","","HOB, R5B","IL2"],["5-HT+betaine (uptake)","+","+","-","+","-","-","-","+","-","5-HT","","NSM*"],["Betaine (uptake)","+","-","-","-","-","-","-","+","-","PDC","","AUA, CAN, RIR*, ASI*"],["Betaine (uptake)","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","+","-","PHD, PVV*","","M3*, AIB, DVB*, SMD*, RIS, PDA*, ASG*, DA9*, PHC, PVN, VA12*, VB1-11*, RMH*"]],"html":"<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th rowspan=\"2\">Synthesis (and/or uptake)</th>\n<th>cat-1</th>\n<th>tph-1</th>\n<th>cat-2</th>\n<th>bas-1</th>\n<th>tdc-1</th>\n<th>tbh-1</th>\n<th>mod-5</th>\n<th>snf-3</th>\n<th>oct-1</th>\n<th rowspan=\"2\">Direct staining</th>\n<th>Sex-specific neurons</th>\n<th>Sex-shared neurons</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th colspan=\"9\"></th>\n<th></th>\n<th></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Unknown monoamine?</td>\n<td>+</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>PVX, PVY</td>\n<td>AVL*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Unknown monoamine?</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>+</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>HOB, R5B</td>\n<td>IL2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5-HT+betaine (uptake)</td>\n<td>+</td>\n<td>+</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>+</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>+</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>5-HT</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>NSM*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Betaine (uptake)</td>\n<td>+</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>+</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>PDC</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>AUA, CAN, RIR*, ASI*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Betaine (uptake)</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>+</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>PHD, PVV*</td>\n<td></td>\n<td>\nM3*, AIB, DVB*, SMD*, RIS, PDA*, ASG*, DA9*, PHC, PVN, VA12*, VB1-11*, RMH*\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","md":"| Synthesis (and/or uptake) | cat-1 | tph-1 | cat-2 | bas-1 | tdc-1 | tbh-1 | mod-5 | snf-3 | oct-1 | Direct staining | Sex-specific neurons | Sex-shared neurons                                                                   |\n| ------------------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Unknown monoamine?

In *mod-5* mutants or wild type worms treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (such as the SSRI fluoxetine), RIH and AIM lose serotonin immunoreactivity (Jafari et al., 2011).

We considered the putative neurotransmitter betaine as a possible candidate,\n                                since CAT-1/VMAT is also able to package betaine (Peden et al., 2013Hardege et al., 2022\n                                                                                                  ;                       ). Betaine\n                                is synthesized endogenously, within the nervous system mostly in the cat- 1/VMAT- positive RIM neuron\n                                (Hardege et al., 2022), but it is also available in the bacterial diet of C. elegans (Peden et al., 2013).\n                                In vertebrates, dietary betaine is taken up by the betaine transporter BGT1 (aka SLC6A12). To test\n                                whether cat- 1/VMAT-\n                                                positive neurons may acquire betaine via BGT1- mediated uptake, we CRISPR/\n                                Cas9-engineered a reporter allele for snf- 3/BGT1, syb7290. We detected expression in the betaine-\n                                synthesizing (and also tyraminergic) RIM neuron (Figure 9,\n                                                                                   Tables 1 and 2). In addition, snf- 3 is indeed\n                                expressed in all the four cat- 1/VMAT- positive neuron classes that do not synthesize a previously known\n                                monoaminergic transmitter (CAN, AUA, and variably, RIR and ASI) (Figure 9A and B). These neurons\n                                may therefore take up betaine and synaptically release it via CAT-\n                                                                                           1/VMAT. The snf- 3(syb7290) reporter\n                                allele is also expressed in the serotonergic neuron NSM (albeit variably) (Tables 1 and 2), thus NSM\n                                could also be a betaine uptake neuron. In addition, we also detected snf- 3(syb7290) expression in\n                                several other neurons that do not express cat- 1(syb6486) (Supplementary file 1). Expression was\n                                also observed in a substantial number of non-  neuronal cell types (Figure  9E–G,         Table  2, Supple-\n                                mentary file 1). These neurons and non-        neuronal cells may serve to clear betaine (see Discussion,\n                                Neurotransmitter synthesis versus uptake). snf- 3(syb7290) is not expressed in the inner and outer\n                                labial neuron classes as previously suggested (Peden et al., 2013); these cells were likely misidentiﬁed\n                                in the previous study and are in fact inner and outer labial glial cells (as discussed further below).\n                                Together with the expression pattern of the uptake transporters, all cat- 1/VMAT- positive  neurons\n                                in the hermaphrodite can be matched with an aminergic neurotransmitter. We nevertheless wondered\n                                whether another presently unknown monoaminergic transmitter, e.g., histamine or other trace\n                                amine, could be synthesized by a previously uncharacterized AAAD enzyme encoded in the C.\n                                elegans genome, hdl- 1 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A;\n                                                                                           Hare and Loer, 2004).

We elaborate on these updates for individual reporter\n                         alleles below.\n\n                         Expression of reporter alleles of Glu/ACh/GABA markers in the male-\n                         specific nervous system\n                         We analyzed eat- 4/VGLUT (syb4257), unc- 17/VAChT (syb4491), unc- 25/GAD (ot1372), and unc- 47/\n                         VGAT (syb7566) expression in the male-                speciﬁc nervous system using NeuroPAL landmark strains\n                         (otIs696 for eat- 4 and otIs669 for all others)(Figures 10 and 11). Of all those reporter alleles, unc- 25/\n                         GAD (ot1372) was the only one with no updated expression. Speciﬁcally, in addition to conﬁrming\n                         presence of expression of the unc- 25(ot1372) reporter allele in CP9, EF1/2, EF3/4, we also conﬁrmed\n                         its lack of expression in anti-     GABA-positive neurons R2A, R6A, and R9B (Gendrel et  al., 2016;\n                         Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b; Figure 11A, Supplementary file 3).\n                         In the preanal ganglion, we observed weak expression of unc- 17(syb4491)  in DX3/4 (Figure 10B,\n                         Supplementary file 3), hence assigning previously unknown neurotransmitter identity to these\n                         neurons. Related to DX3/4, we also conﬁrmed expression of unc- 17 in DX1/2 in the dorsorectal\n                         ganglion, consistent with fosmid- based reporter data (Supplementary file 3;  Serrano- Saiz  et  al.,\n                         2017b). In the lumbar ganglion, we detected novel expression of unc- 17(syb4491) in ﬁve pairs of type\n                         B ray neurons, namely R1B, R4B, R5B, R7B, and R9B (Figure 10B, Supplementary file 3). Expression\n                         in all these neurons is low, possibly explaining why it is not observed with an unc- 17 fosmid- based\n                         reporter (Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b).\n                         In the ventral nerve cord, we found additional, very weak expression of eat- 4(syb4257) in CA1 to\n                         CA4 (Figure 10A, Supplementary file 3), as well as weak expression of unc- 17(syb4491) in CP1 to CP4\n                         (Figure 10B, Supplementary file 3), all undetected by previous analysis of fosmid-      based reporters\n                         (Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b). Conversely, two neurons lack previously reported expression of fosmid-\n                         based reporters; CP9 does not show visible            unc- 17(syb4491) expression (Figure  10B) and neither\n                         does CA9 show visible expression of unc- 47(syb7566) expression (Figure 11C). We also realized that\n                         the neuron identiﬁcations of CA7 and CP7 were previously switched (Serrano-   Saiz et  al., 2017b),\n                         due to lack of proper markers for those two neurons. With NeuroPAL, we are now able to clearly\n                         distinguish the two and update their classic neurotransmitter reporter expression: CA7 expresses\n                         high levels of eat- 4(syb4257) (Figure 10A,\n                                                                               Supplementary file 3), very low levels of unc- 17(syb4491)\n                         (Figure 10B), and no unc- 47(syb7566) (Figure 11C); CP7 expresses no eat- 4(syb4257) (Figure 10A,\n                         Supplementary file 3), very low levels of unc- 17(syb4491) (Figure 10B), and very low levels of unc-\n                         47(syb7566) as well (Figure 11C). Taken together, the analysis of reporter alleles reveals a remarkable\n                         diversity of CA and CP neurons, summarized in Figure 10C.\n                         In the head, we detected expression of unc- 47(syb7566) in the male- speciﬁc neuron class MCM\n                         (Figure 11B, Supplementary file 3), previously not observed with fosmid-\n                                                                                              based reporters.

Specifically, in addition to confirming presence of expression of the *unc-25*(ot1372) reporter allele in CP9, EF1/2, EF3/4, we also confirmed its *lack* of expression in anti-GABA-positive neurons R2A, R6A, and R9B (Gendrel et al., 2016; Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b; **Figure 11A, Supplementary file 3**).\n\nIn the preanal ganglion, we observed weak expression of *unc-17*(syb4491) in DX3/4 (**Figure 10B, Supplementary file 3**), hence assigning previously unknown neurotransmitter identity to these neurons. Related to DX3/4, we also confirmed expression of *unc-17* in DX1/2 in the dorsorectal ganglion, consistent with fosmid-based reporter data (**Supplementary file 3; Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b**). In the lumbar ganglion, we detected novel expression of *unc-17*(syb4491) in five pairs of type B ray neurons, namely R1B, R4B, R5B, R7B, and R9B (**Figure 10B, Supplementary file 3**). Expression in all these neurons is low, possibly explaining why it is not observed with an *unc-17* fosmid-based reporter (Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b).\n\nIn the ventral nerve cord, we found additional, very weak expression of *eat-4*(syb4257) in CA1 to CA4 (**Figure 10A, Supplementary file 3**), as well as weak expression of *unc-17*(syb4491) in CP1 to CP4 (**Figure 10B, Supplementary file 3**), all undetected by previous analysis of fosmid-based reporters (Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b). Conversely, two neurons lack previously reported expression of fosmid-based reporters; CP9 does not show visible *unc-17*(syb4491) expression (**Figure 10B**) and neither does CA9 show visible expression of *unc-47*(syb7566) expression (**Figure 11C**). We also realized that the neuron identifications of CA7 and CP7 were previously switched (Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b), due to lack of proper markers for those two neurons. With NeuroPAL, we are now able to clearly distinguish the two and update their classic neurotransmitter reporter expression:  \n- CA7 expresses high levels of *eat-4*(syb4257) (**Figure 10A, Supplementary file 3**), very low levels of *unc-17*(syb4491) (**Figure 10B**), and no *unc-47*(syb7566) (**Figure 11C**);  \n- CP7 expresses no *eat-4*(syb4257) (**Figure 10A, Supplementary file 3**), very low levels of *unc-17*(syb4491) (**Figure 10B**), and very low levels of *unc-47*(syb7566) as well (**Figure 11C**).  \n\nTaken together, the analysis of reporter alleles reveals a remarkable diversity of CA and CP neurons, summarized in **Figure 10C**.\n\nIn the head, we detected expression of *unc-47*(syb7566) in the male-specific neuron class MCM (**Figure 11B, Supplementary file 3**), previously not observed with fosmid-based reporters. Consistent with fosmid-based reporter data, the other male-specific head neuron class, CEM, shows expression of *unc-17*(syb4491) (**Supplementary file 3**) and *unc-47*(syb7566) (**Figure 11B, Supplementary file 3**) reporter alleles.","bBox":{"x":168.51,"y":182.08,"w":410.22,"h":420.9}},{"type":"heading","lvl":3,"value":"Expression of reporter alleles for monoaminergic neurotransmitter pathway genes in the male-specific nervous system","md":"### Expression of reporter alleles for monoaminergic neurotransmitter pathway genes in the male-specific nervous system  ","bBox":{"x":168.53,"y":182.08,"w":382,"h":464.38}},{"type":"text","value":"We analyzed the expression of reporter alleles for genes involved in monoamine biosynthesis and uptake in the male-specific nervous system: *cat-1*/VMAT (syb6486), *tph-1*/TPH (syb6451), *cat-2*/TH (syb8255), *bas-1*/AAAD (syb5923), *tdc-1*/TDC (syb7768), *tbh-1*/TBH (syb7786), *mod-5*/SERT (vlc47), *oct-1*/OCT (syb8870), and *snf-3*/BGT1 (syb7290).

In addition, we detected previously unreported expression of\n                         tph- 1 (Figure 12B) in the male-speciﬁc head neuron class CEM, as well as in a subset of B- type ray\n                         sensory neurons, R4B and R7B. However, not all of the neurons display additional, canonical seroto-\n                         nergic neuron features: While R4B and R7B express bas- 1(syb5923) (with R4B expressing it variably) to\n                         generate serotonin, neither neuron was detected by anti-serotonin staining in the past.

All these neurons show\n                         matching expression of bas- 1/AAAD, the other essential enzyme for dopamine synthesis, and cat- 1/\n                         VMAT, the vesicular transporter for dopamine (Figure 12A and C; Supplementary file 3).\n\n                         Tyramine and octopamine synthesis\n                         Reporter alleles for the two diagnostic enzymes, tdc- 1/TDC and tbh- 1/TBH, conﬁrm the previously\n                         reported assignment of HOA as tyraminergic (Serrano-  Saiz et  al., 2017b), based on the presence\n                         of tdc- 1(syb7768) but absence of tbh- 1(syb7786) expression (Figure 13 B and C).

In addition, we detected previously unreported expression of *tph-1* (*Figure 12B*) in the male-specific head neuron class CEM, as well as in a subset of B-type ray sensory neurons, R4B and R7B. However, not all of the neurons display additional, canonical serotonergic neuron features: While R4B and R7B express *bas-1*(syb5923) (with R4B expressing it variably) to generate serotonin, neither neuron was detected by anti-serotonin staining in the past. On the other hand, R9B and CEM stain positive for 5-HT (Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b), but they do not express *bas-1*(syb5923), indicating that they may be producing 5-HTP rather than 5-HT (serotonin) (see more below on serotonin uptake). In addition, R4B and R9B, but not R7B or CEM, express *cat-1*(syb6486) for vesicular release of serotonin.\n\nIn the ventral nerve cord, consistent with previous fosmid-based reporter data (Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b), we observed the expression of *cat-1*(syb6486) and *tph-1*(syb6451) in CP1 to CP6 (*Supplementary file 3*). Additionally, we also detected novel expression of *bas-1*(syb5923) in CP1 to CP4 and strongly in CP5 and CP6 (*Figure 12C, Supplementary file 3*). This updated expression supports the serotonergic identities of these neurons, which had been determined previously based only on their expression of *cat-1*/VMAT reporters and positive staining for serotonin (Loer and Kenyon, 1993; Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b).\n\n## Dopamine synthesis\n\nWe found that the expression of the dopamine-synthesizing *cat-2*(syb8255) reporter allele precisely matched previous assignments of dopaminergic identity (Sulston et al., 1975; Sulston et al., 1980; Lints and Emmons, 1999), i.e., expression was detected exclusively in R5A, R7A, and R9A (*Figure 13A, Supplementary file 3*), in addition to all sex-shared dopaminergic neurons. All these neurons show matching expression of *bas-1*/AAAD, the other essential enzyme for dopamine synthesis, and *cat-1*/VMAT, the vesicular transporter for dopamine (*Figure 12A and C; Supplementary file 3*).\n\n## Tyramine and octopamine synthesis\n\nReporter alleles for the two diagnostic enzymes, *tdc-1*/TDC and *tbh-1*/TBH, confirm the previously reported assignment of HOA as tyraminergic (Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b), based on the presence of *tdc-1*(syb7768) but absence of *tbh-1*(syb7786) expression (*Figure 13 B and C*). The *tdc-1* reporter allele reveals a novel site of expression in R7A. Due to lack of *tbh-1* expression, R7A therefore classifies as another tyraminergic neuron. Both HOA and R7A also co-express *cat-1*/VMAT for vesicular release of tyramine (*Figure 12A*).\n\nWe detected no neurons in addition to the sex-shared RIC neuron class that shares all features of a functional octopaminergic neuron, i.e., co-expression of *tbh-1*/TBH, *tdc-1*/TDC, and *cat-1*/VMAT. While one male-specific neuron, R8B, shows an overlap of expression of *tdc-1*(syb7768) and *tbh-1*(syb7786) (*Figure 13B and C*), indicating that these neurons can synthesize octopamine, R8B does not express *cat-1*(syb6486), indicating that it cannot engage in vesicular release of octopamine.\n\nCuriously, while there are no other male-specific neurons that co-express *tdc-1* and *tbh-1*, several male-specific neurons express *tbh-1*, but not *tdc-1* (*Figure 13B and C*; Table 2, Supplementary file 3).

Additionally, we also detected novel expression of *bas-1*(syb5923) in CP1 to CP4 and strongly in CP5 and CP6 (*Figure 12C, Supplementary file 3*). This updated expression supports the serotonergic identities of these neurons, which had been determined previously based only on their expression of *cat-1*/VMAT reporters and positive staining for serotonin (Loer and Kenyon, 1993; Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b).","md":"Serotonergic identity had been assigned to several male-specific neurons before (CP1 to CP6, R1B, R3B, R9B) (Loer and Kenyon, 1993), and we validated these assignments with our reporter alleles (*Figure 12, Supplementary file 3*). In addition, we detected previously unreported expression of *tph-1* (*Figure 12B*) in the male-specific head neuron class CEM, as well as in a subset of B-type ray sensory neurons, R4B and R7B. However, not all of the neurons display additional, canonical serotonergic neuron features: While R4B and R7B express *bas-1*(syb5923) (with R4B expressing it variably) to generate serotonin, neither neuron was detected by anti-serotonin staining in the past. On the other hand, R9B and CEM stain positive for 5-HT (Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b), but they do not express *bas-1*(syb5923), indicating that they may be producing 5-HTP rather than 5-HT (serotonin) (see more below on serotonin uptake).

We consider the trace amine phenylethanolamine (PEOH) as a candi-\n                         date end product (see Discussion).\n\n                         Other monoaminergic neurons\n                         In the preanal ganglion, we detected novel expression of the cat- 1(syb6486) reporter allele in the\n                         cholinergic PDC, PVX, and PVY neurons (Figure 12A). Intriguingly, just as the sex-shared neuron AVL\n                         (Figure 6C), these neurons express no other serotonergic, dopaminergic, tyraminergic, or octopami-\n                         nergic pathway genes. However, we did ﬁnd PDC (but not PVX or PVY) to express the betaine uptake\n                         transporter reporter allele snf- 3(syb7290) (Figure  9; more below). PVX and PVY may synthesize or\n                         uptake another aminergic transmitter. Such presumptive transmitter is not likely to be synthesized by\n                         hdl- 1/AAAD since we detected no expression of the hdl- 1 reporter allele syb4208 in the male nervous\n                         system.\n                         The expression pattern of the bas- 1/AAAD, which had not been previously analyzed in the male-\n                         speciﬁc nervous system, reveals additional novelties. In addition to the ‘canonical’ serotonergic and\n                         dopaminergic neurons described above, we detected bas- 1(syb5923) reporter allele expression in a\n                         substantial number of additional neurons, including the tyraminergic HOA and R7A neurons, but also\n                         the DVE, DVF, R2A, R3A, R6A, R8A, R2B, R6B, R7B, PCB, and SPC neurons (Figure 12C, Supplemen-\n                         tary file 3). As described above, a subset of the neurons co-  express tbh- 1(syb7786) (most B-type\n                         ray neurons), a few co- express tdc- 1(syb7768) (HOA and several A- type ray neurons), and several\n                         co-express neither of these two genes. Only a subset of these neurons express cat- 1(syb6486). Taken\n                         together, this expression pattern analysis argues for the existence of additional monoaminergic\n                         signaling system(s) (Table 2).\n\n                         Serotonin/5-HT uptake\n                         In the male- speciﬁc nervous system, we detected mod- 5/SERT reporter allele expression in CEM,\n                         PGA, R3B, R9B, and ventral cord neurons CP1 to CP6 (Figure  8D). We found that anti-   serotonin\n                         staining in CP1 to CP6, R1B, and R3B is unaffected in mod- 5(n3314) mutant animals, consistent with\n                         these neurons expressing the complete serotonin synthesis machinery (i.e. tph- 1 and bas- 1) (Table 2,\n                         Figure 8B, D, and G;\n                                Supplementary file 3). Hence, like several other monoaminergic neurons, these\n                         serotonergic neurons both synthesize, synaptically release, and reuptake serotonin. In contrast, anti-\n                         serotonin staining is lost from the R9B and PGA neurons of mod- 5(n3314) mutant animals, indicating\n                         that the presence of serotonin in these neurons depends on serotonin uptake, consistent with them\n                         not expressing the complete serotonin synthesis pathway (Table 2; Supplementary file 3). Since R9B\n                         and PGA express cat- 1/VMAT (Figure  12A), these neurons have the option to utilize serotonin for\n                         vesicular release after mod- 5- dependent uptake.\n\n                         Tyramine and betaine uptake\n                         We did not observe oct- 1(syb8870) reporter allele expression in male-  speciﬁc neurons. As in the\n                         hermaphrodite nervous system, we detected snf- 3(syb7290) in a number of neurons that do not\n                         express CAT-1/VMAT (Supplementary file 1), including in male-  speciﬁc neurons PHD, and variably,\n                         PVV (Figure 9C).

We consider the trace amine phenylethanolamine (PEOH) as a candi-  \ndate end product (see Discussion).\n\n## Other monoaminergic neurons  \nIn the preanal ganglion, we detected novel expression of the *cat-1(syb6486)* reporter allele in the  \ncholinergic PDC, PVX, and PVY neurons (**Figure 12A**). Intriguingly, just as the sex-shared neuron AVL  \n(**Figure 6C**), these neurons express no other serotonergic, dopaminergic, tyraminergic, or octopami-  \nnergic pathway genes. However, we did find PDC (but not PVX or PVY) to express the betaine uptake  \ntransporter reporter allele *snf-3(syb7290)* (**Figure 9**; more below). PVX and PVY may synthesize or  \nuptake another aminergic transmitter. Such presumptive transmitter is not likely to be synthesized by  \n*hdl-1/AAAD* since we detected no expression of the *hdl-1* reporter allele *syb4208* in the male nervous  \nsystem.  \nThe expression pattern of the *bas-1/AAAD*, which had not been previously analyzed in the male-  \nspecific nervous system, reveals additional novelties. In addition to the ‘canonical’ serotonergic and  \ndopaminergic neurons described above, we detected *bas-1(syb5923)* reporter allele expression in a  \nsubstantial number of additional neurons, including the tyraminergic HOA and R7A neurons, but also  \nthe DVE, DVF, R2A, R3A, R6A, R8A, R2B, R6B, R7B, PCB, and SPC neurons (**Figure 12C, Supplemen-  \ntary file 3**). As described above, a subset of the neurons co-express *tbh-1(syb7786)* (most B-type  \nray neurons), a few co-express *tdc-1(syb7768)* (HOA and several A-type ray neurons), and several  \nco-express neither of these two genes. Only a subset of these neurons express *cat-1(syb6486)*. Taken  \ntogether, this expression pattern analysis argues for the existence of additional monoaminergic  \nsignaling system(s) (**Table 2**).\n\n## Serotonin/5-HT uptake  \nIn the male-specific nervous system, we detected *mod-5/SERT* reporter allele expression in CEM,  \nPGA, R3B, R9B, and ventral cord neurons CP1 to CP6 (**Figure 8D**). We found that anti-serotonin  \nstaining in CP1 to CP6, R1B, and R3B is unaffected in *mod-5(n3314)* mutant animals, consistent with  \nthese neurons expressing the complete serotonin synthesis machinery (i.e. *tph-1* and *bas-1*) (**Table 2,  \nFigure 8B, D, and G; Supplementary file 3**). Hence, like several other monoaminergic neurons, these  \nserotonergic neurons both synthesize, synaptically release, and reuptake serotonin. In contrast, anti-  \nserotonin staining is lost from the R9B and PGA neurons of *mod-5(n3314)* mutant animals, indicating  \nthat the presence of serotonin in these neurons depends on serotonin uptake, consistent with them  \nnot expressing the complete serotonin synthesis pathway (**Table 2; Supplementary file 3**). Since R9B  \nand PGA express *cat-1/VMAT* (**Figure 12A**), these neurons have the option to utilize serotonin for  \nvesicular release after *mod-5*-dependent uptake.\n\n## Tyramine and betaine uptake  \nWe did not observe *oct-1(syb8870)* reporter allele expression in male-specific neurons. As in the  \nhermaphrodite nervous system, we detected *snf-3(syb7290)* in a number of neurons that do not  \nexpress CAT-1/VMAT (**Supplementary file 1**), including in male-specific neurons PHD, and variably,  \nPVV (**Figure 9C**). As mentioned earlier, the male-specific neuron PDC expresses both *cat-1(syb6486)*  \nand *snf-3(syb7290)*, making it a likely betaine-signaling neuron.\n\n","images":[{"name":"page_28.jpg","height":792,"width":612,"x":0,"y":0,"original_width":2473,"original_height":3200,"type":"full_page_screenshot"}],"charts":[],"items":[{"type":"text","value":"eLife Tools and resources                                                                                           Neuroscience\n\nFigure 11 continued  \nneuron classes MCM and CEM, the former previously undetected and the latter consistent with fosmid-based reporter otIs564.

Since PVN is also cholinergic (Figure 4D;\n                         Pereira et al., 2015), this observation indicates a sexually dimorphic co- transmission conﬁguration.\n                         As described above (Figure 4B, Supplementary file 2), our eat- 4 reporter allele revealed low levels\n                         of eat- 4/VGLUT expression in hermaphrodites PVN, but in males the eat- 4 reporter allele showed\n                         strongly increased expression, compared to hermaphrodites. Hence, rather than being an ‘on’ vs. ‘off’\n                         dimorphism, dimorphic eat- 4/VGLUT expression in male PVN resembles the ‘scaling’ phenomenon\n                         we had described previously for eat- 4/VGLUT in male PHC neurons, compared to hermaphrodite\n                         PHC neurons (Serrano- Saiz et al., 2017a). Both PHC and PVN display a substantial increase in the\n                         amount of synaptic output of these neurons in males compared to hermaphrodites (Cook et  al.,\n                         2019), providing a likely explanation for such scaling of gene expression.

Hence, rather than being an ‘on’ vs. ‘off’ dimorphism, dimorphic *eat-4/VGLUT* expression in male PVN resembles the ‘scaling’ phenomenon we had described previously for *eat-4/VGLUT* in male PHC neurons, compared to hermaphrodite PHC neurons (*Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017a*). Both PHC and PVN display a substantial increase in the amount of synaptic output of these neurons in males compared to hermaphrodites (*Cook et al., 2019*), providing a likely explanation for such scaling of gene expression. The scaling of *eat-4/VGLUT* expression in PVN is not accompanied by scaling of *unc-17/VAChT* expression, which remains comparable in both sexes (Figure 4D).  \n\nWe also examined AIM, another neuron class that was previously reported to be sexually dimorphic in that AIM expresses *eat-4/VGLUT* fosmid-based reporters in juvenile stages in both sexes, whereas upon sexual maturation its neurotransmitter identity is switched from being glutamatergic to cholinergic only in adult males and not hermaphrodites (*Pereira et al., 2015; Pereira et al., 2019*). With the *eat-4(syb4257)* reporter allele, we also detected a downregulation of *eat-4* expression to low levels in young adult males and almost complete elimination in 2-day-old adult males, while expression in hermaphrodites stays high.","bBox":{"x":168.53,"y":173.5,"w":415,"h":236.94}},{"type":"heading","lvl":3,"value":"unc-17/VAChT","md":"### unc-17/VAChT  ","bBox":{"x":0,"y":0,"w":612,"h":792}},{"type":"text","value":"The *unc-17/VAChT* reporter allele *syb4491* confirms that cholinergic identity is indeed male-specifically turned on in the AIM neurons (Figure 4C), thereby confirming the previously reported neurotransmitter switch (*Pereira et al., 2015*).

However, we failed to detect expression of our new cat- 1/VMAT reporter allele\n                         in PVW. Neither did we detect expression of the mod- 5(vlc47) reporter allele. Taken together, PVW\n                         either synthesizes or uptakes serotonin by unconventional means, akin to the pharyngeal I5 neuron.\n                         In conclusion, although there are some updates in the levels of dimorphic gene expression (PVN\n                         and ADF neuron classes), our analysis with reporter alleles does not reveal pervasive novel sexual\n                         dimorphism in sex-shared neurons compared to those that we previously identiﬁed in Serrano- Saiz\n                         et al., 2017b. These sexual dimorphisms are summarized in Supplementary file 4.\n\n                         Neurotransmitter pathway genes in glia\n                         In vertebrates, glia can produce various signaling molecules, including neurotransmitters (Araque\n                         et al., 2014; Savtchouk and Volterra, 2018). There is some limited evidence for neurotransmitter\n                         synthesis in C. elegans glia. In males, it had been reported that the socket glia of spicule neurons\n                         synthesize and utilize dopamine, based on their expression of cat- 2/TH and bas- 1/AAAD (Lints and\n                         Emmons, 1999; Hare and Loer, 2004; LeBoeuf et al., 2014). We conﬁrmed this notion with cat- 2/\n                         TH and bas- 1/AAAD reporter alleles (Figure 14A). Additionally, we detected expression of the cat- 1/\n                         VMAT reporter allele in these cells (Figure  14A), indicating that these glia secrete dopamine by\n                         canonical vesicular transport. We did not detect cat- 1/VMAT in other glial cell types. In addition to the\n                         spicule socket glia, we also observed bas- 1(syb5923) reporter allele expression in cells that are likely\n                         to be the spicule sheath glia (Figure 14A), as well as in additional glial cell types in the head and tail\n                         (Figure 14B). We detected no glial expression of other monoaminergic synthesis machinery.\n                         We detected no expression of vesicular transporters or biosynthetic synthesis machinery for non-\n                         aminergic transmitters in glia of either sex. This observation contrasts previous reports on GABA\n                         synthesis and release from the AMsh glial cell type (Duan et al., 2020;   Fernandez- Abascal  et al.,\n                         2022). We were not able to detect signals in AMsh with anti-GABA staining, nor with an SL2- or T2A-\n                         based GFP- based reporter allele for any unc- 25 isoform (Gendrel et  al., 2016) (M Gendrel, pers.\n                         comm.; this paper).\n                         There is, however, abundant evidence for neurotransmitter uptake by C. elegans glial cells, mirroring\n                         this speciﬁc function of vertebrate glia (Henn and Hamberger, 1971). We had previously shown\n                         that one speciﬁc glia- like cell type in C. elegans, the GLR glia, take up GABA via the GABA uptake\n                         transporter SNF-11 (Gendrel et al., 2016). We did not detect unc- 47/VGAT fosmid- based reporter\n                         expression in the GLRs (Gendrel et al., 2016) and also detected no expression with our\n                                                                                                           unc- 47/VGAT\n                         reporter allele. Hence, these glia are unlikely to release GABA via classic vesicular machinery. Other\n                         release mechanisms for GABA can of course not be excluded. Aside from the snf- 11 expression in\n                         GLR glia (Gendrel et al., 2016), we detected expression of the putative tyramine uptake transporter\n                         oct- 1/OCT in a number of head glial cells (Figure 8K), as well as broad glial expression of the betaine\n                         uptake transporter snf- 3/BGT1 in the head, midbody, and tail (Figure 9E and F). These results indicate\n                         tyramine and betaine clearance roles for glia.\n\n                         Neurotransmitter pathway gene expression outside the nervous\n                         system\n                         We detected expression of a few neurotransmitter pathway genes in cells outside the nervous system.\n                         The most prominent sites of reporter allele expression are located within the gonad.

Because of very dim *cat-1::mCherry* fosmid-based reporter expression that was only detected upon anti-mCherry antibody staining, we had assigned PVW as a serotonin-releasing neuron (*Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b*). However, we failed to detect expression of our new *cat-1/VMAT* reporter allele in PVW. Neither did we detect expression of the *mod-5(vlc47)* reporter allele. Taken together, PVW either synthesizes or uptakes serotonin by unconventional means, akin to the pharyngeal I5 neuron.\n\nIn conclusion, although there are some updates in the levels of dimorphic gene expression (PVN and ADF neuron classes), our analysis with reporter alleles does not reveal pervasive novel sexual dimorphism in sex-shared neurons compared to those that we previously identified in *Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b*. These sexual dimorphisms are summarized in **Supplementary file 4**.\n\n## Neurotransmitter pathway genes in glia\n\nIn vertebrates, glia can produce various signaling molecules, including neurotransmitters (*Araque et al., 2014; Savtchouk and Volterra, 2018*). There is some limited evidence for neurotransmitter synthesis in *C. elegans* glia. In males, it had been reported that the socket glia of spicule neurons synthesize and utilize dopamine, based on their expression of *cat-2/TH* and *bas-1/AAAD* (*Lints and Emmons, 1999; Hare and Loer, 2004; LeBoeuf et al., 2014*). We confirmed this notion with *cat-2/TH* and *bas-1/AAAD* reporter alleles (Figure 14A). Additionally, we detected expression of the *cat-1/VMAT* reporter allele in these cells (Figure 14A), indicating that these glia secrete dopamine by canonical vesicular transport. We did not detect *cat-1/VMAT* in other glial cell types. In addition to the spicule socket glia, we also observed *bas-1(syb5923)* reporter allele expression in cells that are likely to be the spicule sheath glia (Figure 14A), as well as in additional glial cell types in the head and tail (Figure 14B). We detected no glial expression of other monoaminergic synthesis machinery.\n\nWe detected no expression of vesicular transporters or biosynthetic synthesis machinery for non-aminergic transmitters in glia of either sex. This observation contrasts previous reports on GABA synthesis and release from the AMsh glial cell type (*Duan et al., 2020; Fernandez-Abascal et al., 2022*). We were not able to detect signals in AMsh with anti-GABA staining, nor with an SL2- or T2A-based GFP-based reporter allele for any *unc-25* isoform (*Gendrel et al., 2016*) (M Gendrel, pers. comm.; this paper).\n\nThere is, however, abundant evidence for neurotransmitter uptake by *C. elegans* glial cells, mirroring this specific function of vertebrate glia (*Henn and Hamberger, 1971*). We had previously shown that one specific glia-like cell type in *C. elegans*, the GLR glia, take up GABA via the GABA uptake transporter SNF-11 (*Gendrel et al., 2016*). We did not detect *unc-47/VGAT* fosmid-based reporter expression in the GLRs (*Gendrel et al., 2016*) and also detected no expression with our *unc-47/VGAT* reporter allele. Hence, these glia are unlikely to release GABA via classic vesicular machinery. Other release mechanisms for GABA can of course not be excluded. Aside from the *snf-11* expression in GLR glia (*Gendrel et al., 2016*), we detected expression of the putative tyramine uptake transporter *oct-1/OCT* in a number of head glial cells (Figure 8K), as well as broad glial expression of the betaine uptake transporter *snf-3/BGT1* in the head, midbody, and tail (Figure 9E and F). These results indicate tyramine and betaine clearance roles for glia.\n\n## Neurotransmitter pathway gene expression outside the nervous system\n\nWe detected expression of a few neurotransmitter pathway genes in cells outside the nervous system. The most prominent sites of reporter allele expression are located within the gonad. We detected expression of *tdc-1(syb7768)* and *tbh-1(syb7786)* reporter alleles in the gonad of hermaphrodite as well as *tdc-1(syb7768)* expression in the neuroendocrine uv1 cells (Figure 14C; Figure 14—figure supplement 1), as previously reported (*Alkema et al., 2005*).

This suggests that GABA\n                         may be acquired by these neurons through non- canonical uptake or synthesis mechanisms. Also, the\n                         AVA and AVB neurons do not express UNC-47 (Gendrel et al., 2016; Taylor et al., 2021) (this study);\n                         hence, it is not clear if or how GABA is released from them. A member of the bestrophin family of\n                         ion channels has been shown to mediate GABA release from astrocyte glia in vertebrates (Lee et al.,\n                         2010) and, more recently, from C. elegans glia (Cheng et al., 2024;\n                                                                                        Graziano et al., 2024). However,\n                         while there are more than 20 bestrophin channels encoded in the C. elegans genome (Hobert, 2013),\n                         they do not appear to be expressed in the AVA or AVB neurons, based on CeNGEN scRNA data\n                         (Taylor et al., 2021).\n                         The co- expression of a speciﬁc uptake transporter and a vesicular transporter corroborates the\n                         potential usage of betaine as a neurotransmitter. Betaine is known to be synthesized in C. elegans\n                         but is also taken up via its diet (Peden et al., 2013; Hardege et al., 2022). Betaine has documented\n                         effects on C. elegans behavior and acts via activation of several betaine- gated ion channels (Peden\n                         et al., 2013; Hardege et al., 2022). Expression of biosynthetic enzymes suggests betaine production\n                         in at least the RIM neuron class, which also expresses the vesicular transporter cat- 1/VMAT, capable of\n                         transporting betaine (Hardege et al., 2022). The expression of the betaine uptake transporter snf- 3/\n                         BGT1 in CAN, AUA, RIR, ASI, and male-                 speciﬁc neuron PDC, coupled with their co- expression of\n                         cat- 1/VMAT, suggests that several distinct neuron classes in different parts of the nervous system may\n                         uptake betaine and engage in vesicular betaine release via CAT-\n                                                                                   1/VMAT to gate betaine-activated ion\n                         channels, such as ACR- 23 (Peden et al., 2013) or LGC- 41 (Hardege et al., 2022). Additionally, we\n                         detected the snf- 3/BGT1 reporter allele in several other neuron classes that do not co-\n                                                                                                                          express cat- 1/\n                         VMAT. This indicates that these neurons could function as betaine clearance neurons.\n                         Lastly, based on sequence similarity and expression pattern, we predict that the ortholog of the\n                         OCT subclass of SLC22 family, oct- 1, could serve as a tyramine uptake transporter in C. elegans. We\n                         identiﬁed RIM as the only neuron expressing an oct- 1 reporter allele, suggesting that like several other\n                         monoaminergic neuron classes, RIM both synthesizes its monoaminergic transmitter and reuptakes it\n                         after release.\n\n                         Evidence for usage of currently unknown neurotransmitters\n                         Novel amino acid transmitters?\n                         unc- 47/VGAT is expressed in a substantial number of non- GABAergic neurons (95 out of 302 total\n                         neurons in hermaphrodites, plus 61 out of 93 male-    speciﬁc neurons). However, expression in many\n                         of these non- GABAergic neurons is low and variable and such expression may not lead to sufﬁcient\n                         amounts of a functional gene product. Yet, in some neurons (e.g. the SIA neurons) expression of\n                         unc- 47 is easily detectable and robust (based on fosmid- based reporter, reporter allele, and scRNA\n                         data), indicating that VGAT may transport another presently unknown neurotransmitter (Gendrel\n                         et al., 2016). In vertebrates, VGAT transports both GABA and glycine, and the same is observed for\n                         UNC-47 in vitro (Aubrey et al., 2007). While the C. elegans genome encodes no easily recognizable\n                         ortholog of known ionotropic glycine receptors, it does encode anion channels that are closely related\n                         by primary sequence (Hobert, 2013). Moreover, a recently identiﬁed metabotropic glycine receptor,\n                         GPR158 (Laboute et  al., 2023), has a clear sequence ortholog in C. elegans, F39B2.8. Therefore,\n                         glycine may also act as a neurotransmitter in C. elegans. VGAT has also been shown to transport β-al-\n                         anine (Juge et al., 2013), another potential, but as yet unexplored, neurotransmitter in         C. elegans.\n                         However, it needs to be pointed out that most of the additional unc- 47\n                                                                                             positive neurons do not co-\n                                                                                                -                         ex-\n                         press the LAMP-type UNC-46 protein, which is important for sorting UNC- 47/VGAT to synaptic vesi-\n                         cles in conventional GABAergic neurons (Schuske et al., 2007).

Second, not only do these neurons express a multitude of neuropeptide-encoding genes (*Taylor et al., 2021*), but they also display a dense interconnectivity in the ‘wireless’ neuropeptidergic connectome (*Ripoll-Sánchez et al., 2023*).\n\nThat said, electron microscopy shows that some of the neurons devoid of conventional neurotransmitter pathway genes generate synapses with small, clear synaptic vesicles, indicative of the use of non-peptidergic transmitters (e.g. the sex-shared RMG and PVM neurons or the male-specific SPD neurons) (*White et al., 1986; Cook et al., 2019; Witvliet et al., 2021*). It is therefore conceivable that either conventional neurotransmitters utilize non-conventional neurotransmitter synthesis and/or release pathways, or that completely novel neurotransmitter systems remain to be discovered. Although the *C. elegans* genome does not encode additional members of the SLC18A2/3 (*cat-1/VMAT, unc-17/VAChT*) or SLC32A1 (*unc-47/VGAT*) family of vesicular neurotransmitter transporters, it does contain a number of additional members of the SLC17A6/7/8 (VGLUT) family (*Hobert, 2013*).","bBox":{"x":168.53,"y":506.48,"w":416.01,"h":176.96}}],"status":"OK","originalOrientationAngle":0,"links":[{"url":"https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.95402","unsafeUrl":"https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.95402","text":". eLife 2024;13:RP95402.

The most prominent co-  transmission conﬁguration is acetylcholine\n                         with glutamate, but acetylcholine can also be co-     transmitted with GABA. There are no examples\n                         of co- transmission of glutamate and GABA, as observed in several regions of the vertebrate brain\n                         (Wallace and Sabatini, 2023).

However, since very low levels of unc- 25 are\n                         observed in the AMsh scRNA datasets (Taylor et al., 2021;  Purice et al., 2023), the abundance of\n                         GABA in AMsh may lie below conventional detection levels.\n                         Outside the nervous system, the most prominent and functionally best characterized usage of\n                         neurotransmitters lies in the hermaphrodite somatic gonad, which has been shown to synthesize octo-\n                         pamine and use it to control oocyte quiescence (Alkema et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2021). Intriguingly,\n                         we also detected tbh- 1,  tdc- 1, and cat- 1 expression in the somatic gonad of the male, speciﬁcally the\n                         vas deferens, which is known to contain secretory granules that are positive for secretory molecular\n                         markers (Nonet et al., 1993). The presence of octopamine is unexpected because, unlike oocytes,\n                         sperm are not presently known to require monoaminergic signals for any aspect of their maturation. It\n                         will be interesting to assess sperm differentiation and function of tbh- 1 or tdc- 1 mutant animals. The\n                         usage of monoaminergic signaling systems in the gonad is not restricted to C. elegans and has been\n                         discussed in the context of sperm functionality and oocyte maturation in vertebrates (Mayerhofer\n                         et al., 1999; Ramírez-Reveco et al., 2017; Alhajeri et al., 2022).\n\n                         Comparing approaches and caveats of expression pattern analysis\n                         Our analysis also provides an unprecedented and systematic comparison of antibody staining, scRNA\n                         transcript data, reporter transgene expression, and knock- in reporter allele expression.

Another factor to consider is\n                         that neuron identiﬁcation for most fosmid- based reporters was carried out prior to the introduction\n                         of NeuroPAL. Consequently, errors occasionally occurred, as exempliﬁed by the misidentiﬁcation of\n                         neuron IDs for CA7 and CP7 in previous instances (Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b).

Conversely, antibody staining displays vagaries related\n                         to staining protocols and protein localization, which can be overcome with reporter approaches, but\n                         the price to pay with reporter alleles is that if they are based on SL2 or T2A strategies, they may fail\n                         to detect additional levels of posttranslational regulation, which may result in protein absence even\n                         in the presence of transcripts. The existence of such mechanisms may be a possible explanation for\n                         cases where the expression of synthesis and/or transport machinery expression does not match up\n                         (e.g. tdc- 1(-); tbh- 1(+) neurons).\n                         Our detailed analysis of reporter allele expression has uncovered several cases where expression\n                         of a neurotransmitter pathway gene in a given neuron class appears very low and variable from animal\n                         to animal.

Efforts to map neurotransmitter usage on a system-    wide level are\n                         underway in other organisms, most notably, Drosophila melanogaster (Deng et al., 2019;  Eckstein\n                         et al., 2024). The C. elegans neurotransmitter map presented here comprises a critical step toward\n                         deciphering information ﬂow in the nervous system and provides valuable tools for studying the\n                         genetic mechanisms underlying cell identity speciﬁcation.
