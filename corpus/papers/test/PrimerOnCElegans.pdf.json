Over time, research on C. elegans\nhas expanded to explore a wealth of diverse areas in modern biology including studies of the basic functions and interactions of\neukaryotic cells, host–parasite interactions, and evolution.                    C. elegans has also become an important organism in which to study\nprocesses that go awry in human diseases. This primer introduces the organism and the many features that make it an outstanding\nexperimental system, including its small size, rapid life cycle, transparency, and well-annotated genome. We survey the basic anatom-\nical features, common technical approaches, and important discoveries in C. elegans research. Key to studying C. elegans has been the\nability to address biological problems genetically, using both forward and reverse genetics, both at the level of the entire organism and\nat the level of the single, identiﬁed cell. These possibilities make C. elegans useful not only in research laboratories, but also in the\nclassroom where it can be used to excite students who actually can see what is happening inside live cells and tissues.\nKEYWORDS C. elegans; nematodes; Primer; single-cell analysis; transparent genetic system\n\n     TABLE OF CONTENTS\n     Abstract                                                                                                                                                          387\n     Introduction                                                                                                                                                      388\n     C. elegans Basics                                                                                                                                                 389\n         Growth and maintenance                                                                                                                                        389\n         Sexual forms and their importance                                                                                                                             390\n         Life cycle                                                                                                                                                    391\n     C. elegans Genetics                                                                                                                                               391\n                                                                                                                                                                Continued\nCopyright © 2015 Corsi, Wightman, and Chalﬁe\ndoi: 10.1534/genetics.115.176099\nThis is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Unported License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/), which permits\nunrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n1Corresponding authors: Biology Department, The Catholic University of America, Washington, DC 20064.

With the simplicity and\npower of prokaryotic genetics in mind, he proposed that\na nematode (round worm),             Caenorhabditis briggsae, would\nbe an ideal system in which to tackle these problems.\nLater, he settled on the related nematode                   C. elegans     as\nthe focus of his efforts because the               elegans    strain grew\nbetter than the        briggsae    isolate in Brenner’s laboratory\n(Félix 2008).

Their small size means that the animals usually are ob-\nserved with either dissecting microscopes, which generally al-\nlow up to 100X magniﬁcation, or compound microscopes,\nwhich allow up to 1000X magniﬁcation. The dissecting micro-\nscope is used to observe worms on Petri dishes (Figure 1, A and\nB) as they move, eat, develop, mate, and lay eggs (for movies\nshowing these features, see http://labs.bio.unc.edu/Goldstein/\nmovies.html). A compound or confocal microscope allows ob-\nservation at much        ﬁner resolution (Figure 1C), permitting\nresearchers to perform experiments that address questions re-\nlated to cell development and function at single-cell resolution.\nBecause C. elegans is transparent, individual cells and subcel-\nlular details are easily visualized using Nomarski (differential\ninterference contrast, DIC) optics (Figure 1C). Enhanced detail\n388      A. K. Corsi, B. Wightman, and M. Chalﬁe\n\ncan be discerned by using ﬂuorescent proteins to tag proteins\nor subcellular compartments (Figure 1D). Fluorescent proteins\ncan also be used to study developmental processes, screen for\nmutants affecting cell development and function, isolate cells,\nand characterize protein interactions            in vivo    (Chalﬁe    et al.\n1994; Boulin et al. 2006; Feinberg et al. 2008).\n    C. elegans has a rapid life cycle (3 days at 25° from egg to\negg-laying adult) and exists primarily as a self-fertilizing\nhermaphrodite, although males arise at a frequency of\n,0.2% (Figure 2). These features have helped to make\nC. elegans a powerful model of choice for eukaryotic genetic\nstudies. In addition, because the animal has an invariant\nnumber of somatic cells, researchers have been able to track\nthe fate of every cell between fertilization and adulthood in\nlive animals and to generate a complete cell lineage (Sulston\nand Horvitz 1977; Kimble and Hirsh 1979; Sulston                       et al.\n1983). Researchers have also reconstructed the shape of all\nC. elegans    cells from electron micrographs, including each of\nthe 302 neurons of the adult hermaphrodite (White                      et al.\n1986) and the posterior mating circuit in the adult male\n(Jarrell   et al.  2012). These reconstructions have provided\nthe most complete “wiring diagrams”              of any nervous system\nand have helped to explain how sexual dimorphism affects\nneuronal circuits.

With the simplicity and power of prokaryotic genetics in mind, he proposed that a nematode (round worm), Caenorhabditis briggsae, would be an ideal system in which to tackle these problems. Later, he settled on the related nematode C. elegans as the focus of his efforts because the elegans strain grew better than the briggsae isolate in Brenner’s laboratory (Félix 2008). Today, C. elegans is actively studied in over a thousand laboratories worldwide (www.wormbase.org) with over 1200 C. elegans research articles published each year for the last 5 years.\n\nC. elegans is a tiny, free-living nematode found worldwide. Newly hatched larvae are 0.25 mm long and adults are 1 mm long. Their small size means that the animals usually are observed with either dissecting microscopes, which generally allow up to 100X magnification, or compound microscopes, which allow up to 1000X magnification. The dissecting microscope is used to observe worms on Petri dishes (Figure 1, A and B) as they move, eat, develop, mate, and lay eggs (for movies showing these features, see http://labs.bio.unc.edu/Goldstein/movies.html). A compound or confocal microscope allows observation at much finer resolution (Figure 1C), permitting researchers to perform experiments that address questions related to cell development and function at single-cell resolution. Because C. elegans is transparent, individual cells and subcellular details are easily visualized using Nomarski (differential interference contrast, DIC) optics (Figure 1C). Enhanced detail can be discerned by using fluorescent proteins to tag proteins or subcellular compartments (Figure 1D). Fluorescent proteins can also be used to study developmental processes, screen for mutants affecting cell development and function, isolate cells, and characterize protein interactions in vivo (Chalfi et al. 1994; Boulin et al. 2006; Feinberg et al. 2008).\n\nC. elegans has a rapid life cycle (3 days at 25° from egg to egg-laying adult) and exists primarily as a self-fertilizing hermaphrodite, although males arise at a frequency of ,0.2% (Figure 2). These features have helped to make C. elegans a powerful model of choice for eukaryotic genetic studies. In addition, because the animal has an invariant number of somatic cells, researchers have been able to track the fate of every cell between fertilization and adulthood in live animals and to generate a complete cell lineage (Sulston and Horvitz 1977; Kimble and Hirsh 1979; Sulston et al. 1983). Researchers have also reconstructed the shape of all C. elegans cells from electron micrographs, including each of the 302 neurons of the adult hermaphrodite (White et al. 1986) and the posterior mating circuit in the adult male (Jarrell et al. 2012). These reconstructions have provided the most complete “wiring diagrams” of any nervous system and have helped to explain how sexual dimorphism affects neuronal circuits. Moreover, because of the invariant wild-type cell lineage and neuroanatomy of C. elegans, mutations that give rise to developmental and behavioral defects are readily identified in genetic screens. Finally, because C. elegans was the first multicellular organism with a complete genome sequence (C. elegans Sequencing Consortium 1998), forward and reverse genetics have led to the molecular identification of many key genes in developmental and cell biological processes.\n\nThe experimental strengths and the similarities between the cellular and molecular processes present in C. elegans and other animals across evolutionary time (metabolism,",

Kratz.\n\n# C. elegans Basics\n\n# Growth and maintenance\n\nC. elegans, although often mischaracterized as a soil nematode, can most easily be isolated from rotting vegetable matter, which contains an ample supply of their bacterial food source (Barrière and Félix 2014). In the laboratory, animals are normally grown on agar plates containing a lawn of the bacterium *Escherichia coli*. Once the animals deplete the bacteria, they utilize their fat supply. Without food, the development of young larval-stage animals is arrested.\n\nAs a result of entering this stasis, animals can survive for at least a month (often starved plates can be usefully kept for up to 6 months at 15°), and as stocks, they do not require constant feeding. Whenever healthy, growing animals are needed, a piece of the agar from the old plate can be transferred to a new plate with bacteria. The animals move to the new bacteria and resume their development.\n\nSeveral other features greatly facilitate the maintenance of C. elegans stocks and their experimental use. First, because C. elegans is a self-fertilizing hermaphrodite (see the following section), a single animal can populate a plate. Second, animal populations can be frozen for years and revived when needed. Third, the animal’s small size means that many can be grown in a small space. Fourth, animals can be grown at temperatures ranging from 12° to 25°; their Q10 for growth is 2 (that is, an increase of 10° speeds up growth twofold).\n\nGrowth at different temperatures makes it possible to control the rate of animal development and assists in the isolation and use of temperature-sensitive mutants. Continual growth above 25° is not possible because the animals become sterile. The upper temperature limit can be a problem if animals are kept on bench tops (instead of temperature-controlled incubators) in rooms that are too warm. Shorter exposures to higher temperatures are possible for heat shock experiments and to increase production of.",

Overall, the animals are inexpensive and convenient to maintain.\n\n# Sexual forms and their importance\n\nWild-type C. elegans has two sexual forms: self-fertilizing hermaphrodites and males (Figure 2 and Figure 3, A and B). The gonad of hermaphrodites forms an ovotestis that first produces haploid amoeboid sperm that are stored in the spermatheca in the L4 stage and then near adulthood the germ line switches fate to produce much larger oocytes. Essentially hermaphrodites are females whose gonads temporarily produce sperm before they produce oocytes. Hermaphrodites can produce up to 300 self-progeny that are fertilized by the stored sperm. If mated with males, hermaphrodites are capable of producing 1000 offspring, indicating that hermaphrodite-produced sperm is a limiting factor in self-fertilization. Both sexes are diploid for the five autosomal chromosomes. The sexes differ in that hermaphrodites have two X chromosomes and males have a single X chromosome—C. elegans has no Y chromosome—and the genotype of males is referred to as XO. Sex is determined by the X to autosome (X:A) ratio (Zarkower 2006). The majority of offspring produced by self-fertilization are hermaphrodites; only 0.1–0.2% of the progeny are males due to rare meiotic nondisjunction of the X chromosome.\n\nBecause hermaphrodites make their own sperm, in genetic crosses self-progeny (oocytes fertilized by the hermaphrodite’s sperm) need to be distinguished from cross-progeny. For example, when hermaphrodites homozygous for a recessive mutation causing a visible mutant phenotype are mated to wild-type males, the self-progeny hermaphrodites show the mutant phenotype and the cross-progeny hermaphrodites do not. Self-fertilizing hermaphrodites provide several advantages for genetic analysis. First, self-fertilization (often referred to as selfing) simplifies maintaining stocks because a single animal can give rise to an entire population. Second, as Brenner (1974) has written, “the animals are driven to homozygosity,” i.e., populations of hermaphrodites tend to lose heterozygotes (because hermaphrodites cannot mate with other hermaphrodites). Thus, strains that are mutagenized are essentially isogenic. Third, selfing follows the standard Mendelian rules of segregation, so a parent that is heterozygous for a recessive trait will produce the standard 1:2:1 pattern of segregation, such that 25% of the progeny will be homozygous for the mutant allele and display the autosomal recessive trait. Thus, selfing reduces greatly the effort needed to find such mutants. Fourth, mutants with neuromuscular defects that impair the ability to mate can still be maintained in the laboratory. In fact, only 11 of the 302 nerve cells of the hermaphrodite: eight ADF, ASG, ASI, and ASJ neurons, which when killed as a group cause the animals to become dauer larvae (Bargmann and Horvitz 1991), the two CAN cells (Forrester and Garriga 1997), and the M4 neuron in the pharynx (Avery and Horvitz 1989) are known to be essential to support development to the reproductive adult stage. Fifth, the viability of even severely defective mutants and their ability to self-fertilize allows for easy screens for modifier (enhancer and suppressor).",

First, self-fertilization (often referred to as selfing) simplifies maintaining stocks because a single animal can give rise to an entire population. Second, as Brenner (1974) has written, “the animals are driven to homozygosity,” i.e., populations of hermaphrodites tend to lose heterozygotes (because hermaphrodites cannot mate with other hermaphrodites). Thus, strains that are mutagenized are essentially isogenic. Third, selfing follows the standard Mendelian rules of segregation, so a parent that is heterozygous for a recessive trait will produce the standard 1:2:1 pattern of segregation, such that 25% of the progeny will be homozygous for the mutant allele and display the autosomal recessive trait. Thus, selfing reduces greatly the effort needed to find such mutants. Fourth, mutants with neuromuscular defects that impair the ability to mate can still be maintained in the laboratory. In fact, only 11 of the 302 nerve cells of the hermaphrodite: eight ADF, ASG, ASI, and ASJ neurons, which when killed as a group cause the animals to become dauer larvae (Bargmann and Horvitz 1991), the two CAN cells (Forrester and Garriga 1997), and the M4 neuron in the pharynx (Avery and Horvitz 1989) are known to be essential to support development to the reproductive adult stage. Fifth, the viability of even severely defective mutants and their ability to self-fertilize allows for easy screens for modifier (enhancer and suppressor).",
          "md": "Wild-type C. elegans has two sexual forms: self-fertilizing hermaphrodites and males (Figure 2 and Figure 3, A and B). The gonad of hermaphrodites forms an ovotestis that first produces haploid amoeboid sperm that are stored in the spermatheca in the L4 stage and then near adulthood the germ line switches fate to produce much larger oocytes. Essentially hermaphrodites are females whose gonads temporarily produce sperm before they produce oocytes. Hermaphrodites can produce up to 300 self-progeny that are fertilized by the stored sperm. If mated with males, hermaphrodites are capable of producing 1000 offspring, indicating that hermaphrodite-produced sperm is a limiting factor in self-fertilization. Both sexes are diploid for the five autosomal chromosomes. The sexes differ in that hermaphrodites have two X chromosomes and males have a single X chromosome—C. elegans has no Y chromosome—and the genotype of males is referred to as XO. Sex is determined by the X to autosome (X:A) ratio (Zarkower 2006). The majority of offspring produced by self-fertilization are hermaphrodites; only 0.1–0.2% of the progeny are males due to rare meiotic nondisjunction of the X chromosome.\n\nBecause hermaphrodites make their own sperm, in genetic crosses self-progeny (oocytes fertilized by the hermaphrodite’s sperm) need to be distinguished from cross-progeny. For example, when hermaphrodites homozygous for a recessive mutation causing a visible mutant phenotype are mated to wild-type males, the self-progeny hermaphrodites show the mutant phenotype and the cross-progeny hermaphrodites do not.

Such screens have been exceptionally useful and informative. For example, lin-12 mutants (C. elegans nomenclature is outlined in Box 1) are defective in vulval development and components of the LIN-12/Notch signaling pathway have been identified with both suppressor and enhancer screens (Greenwald and Kovall 2013).\n\nMales are important because they allow the exchange of genetic material needed to generate animals with different genetic compositions and to map genes. Indeed, the animal has evolved to take advantage of the genetic contribution of rare males by using male (outcross) sperm before using hermaphrodite (self) sperm (Ward and Carrel 1979). Thus, if males are capable of mating, cross-progeny prevail (to help males find hermaphrodites, researchers use Petri plates with a small spot of bacteria).\n\n# Life cycle\n\nC. elegans embryogenesis takes 16 hr at 20° (all of the subsequent times are also for development at 20°) (Figure 2). A virtually impermeable eggshell is made after fertilization, allowing the embryo to develop completely independent of the mother. However, embryos are usually retained within the hermaphrodite until about the 24-cell stage at which time they are laid. The hermaphrodite embryo hatches with 558 nuclei (some nuclei are in multinuclear syncytia, so the cell count is lower) and becomes a first stage (L1) larva. The animals begin to eat and develop through four larval stages (L1–L4). The L1 stage is 16 hr long; the other stages are 12 hr long. Each stage ends with a sleep-like period of inactivity called lethargus (Raizen et al. 2008) in which a new cuticle (outer collagenous layer) is made. Lethargus ends with the molting of the old cuticle. Approximately 12 hr after the L4 molt, adult hermaphrodites begin producing progeny for a period of 2–3 days until they have utilized all of their self-produced sperm; additional progeny can be generated if the sperm-depleted hermaphrodite mates with a male. After the reproductive period, hermaphrodites can live several more weeks before dying of senescence.\n\nWhen bacteria are depleted and the animals are crowded, L2 larvae activate an alternative life cycle (Hu 2007) and molt into an alternative L3 larval stage called the “dauer” larva (“dauer” in German means “lasting”; the signal is actually processed by L1 animals, but its results are not seen until the so-called “L2d” stage; Golden and Riddle 1984). The dauer larva cuticle completely surrounds the animal and plugs the mouth preventing the animal from eating and thereby arresting development. The dauer cuticle has enhanced resistance to chemicals, so it provides the dauer with greater protection against environmental stresses and caustic agents. Dauer larvae can survive for many months and are the dispersal form most commonly encountered in the wild. When the dauer larvae are transferred onto plates with bacteria, they shed their mouth plugs, molt, and continue their development as slightly different L4 larvae.\n\n# C. elegans Genetics\n\nA major reason Brenner (1974) chose to study C. elegans was the ease of genetic manipulation. Self-fertilization means that after hermaphrodites (P0s) are mutagenized, any mutant alleles (except dominant lethals) can be maintained through self-propagation in first-generation (F1) progeny, and second-generation (F2) progeny, etc. without mating. This property makes obtaining these progeny easy. In practice, C. elegans researchers screen for mutations anywhere in the genome (instead of using balanced strains to mutagenize single chromosomes) in a single mutagenesis and determine linkage afterward. A second genetic advantage of C. elegans is that it grows quickly. Since animals take 3 days at 25° (3.5).",

The hermaphrodite embryo hatches with 558 nuclei (some nuclei are in multinuclear syncytia, so the cell count is lower) and becomes a first stage (L1) larva. The animals begin to eat and develop through four larval stages (L1–L4). The L1 stage is 16 hr long; the other stages are 12 hr long. Each stage ends with a sleep-like period of inactivity called lethargus (Raizen et al. 2008) in which a new cuticle (outer collagenous layer) is made. Lethargus ends with the molting of the old cuticle. Approximately 12 hr after the L4 molt, adult hermaphrodites begin producing progeny for a period of 2–3 days until they have utilized all of their self-produced sperm; additional progeny can be generated if the sperm-depleted hermaphrodite mates with a male.

Cosmids, proteins, phenotypes, and strain names are not written in italics.\n\n     Mutation (allele) names: The wild-type allele of any gene is designated by an italicized plus sign, 1. Mutant alleles are\n represented by 1-3 lowercase letters, which indicate speciﬁc laboratories, followed by a number. All gene and allele symbols\n are italicized, e.g., unc-54, e678, and mn5. The homozygous genotype is represented by a single copy of the allele name\n (e678). A heterozygous condition is indicated with a slash,                         e.g., e364/1,       e364/e1099.       Chromosomal abnormalities are\n indicated by one or two letters after the lab code, e.g., mnDp30 is a duplication, nDf6 is a deletion (called a deﬁciency), and\n szT1 is a translocation. One or two letters may be added after the allele name to indicate particular properties conveyed by\n the mutation       e.g. temperature-sensitivity (ts), amber (am), revertant (r), dominant (d), and semidominant (sd). When\n a gene has more than one mutation, such as could result from the intragenic reversion of a mutant allele, both the old and\n new mutations are indicated, e.g., intragenic reversion of e1498 could yield e1498u124r.\n     Gene names: Genes are designated by 3 or 4 lower case letters, a dash, and a number (all italicized), e.g. lon-2 and ensh-1.\n To distinguish alleles of the same gene, the allele names are placed in parentheses with no space between the gene and allele\n name,    e.g., mec-7(e1343)         and   mec-7(e1506). Genes that have been identiﬁed as an open reading frame (ORF) through\n bioinformatics approaches get a systematic gene identiﬁcation (e.g. ZK154.3) until subsequent studies prompts them to be\n given a gene name. The upstream promoter region of a gene is indicated by the gene name followed by a “p.” The promoter\n and the protein-coding names are separated by two colons as are parts of fusion proteins. Thus, a gene encoding a MEC-7::GFP\n translational fusion driven from the mec-7 promoter would be mec-7::gfp, whereas a mab-5 transcriptional fusion would be\n mab-5p::gfp. A transposon insertion into a gene is similarly shown using the transposon name and two colons, e.g., unc-22::Tc1\n [most C. elegans transposons are labeled Tc (transposon, Caenorhabditis) and a number].\n     Phenotypes: Mutant phenotypes are designated by the non-italicized gene name without the dash and number and with\n the  ﬁrst letter capitalized, e.g., Unc or Sma animals are Uncoordinated or Small in body size.\n     Gene products: RNAs are designated by the italicized gene name; proteins are designated by the gene name in all caps\n and not italicized (MEC-7). Sometimes speciﬁc amino acid changes are indicated.\n     Strain names: Two capital letters and a number,                        e.g. CB429 and TU38, designate a strain containing one or more\n genetic differences. The letters indicate the laboratory that constructed the strain (http://www.cbs.umn.edu/research/\n resources/cgc/lab-head). None of these symbols are italicized. Because a given strain can carry more than one mutation, strain\n names can be thought of as shorthand to describe animals carrying complicated genotypes. Genes (and/or alleles) in strains with\n several mutations are listed in chromosome and then map order with genes on the same chromosome separated by spaces and\n genes on different chromosomes separated by semi-colons. The italicized name of the chromosome can also be included, e.g., lon-2\n (e678) mec-7(e1506) X, unc-54; myo-3, and e364; e66; u38/szT1. szT1 is one of many balancer chromosomes that are often used\n to maintain mutations that are lethal as homozygotes but viable as heterozygotes. For strains that contain reporter genes, there are\n two typical designations. The reporters are named for speciﬁc laboratories similar to mutant alleles, and they are further named\n according to whether the reporter gene is maintained extrachromosomally on a multicopy array using an “Ex” label (e.g. evEx1) or\n is maintained by integrating the sequence (in most cases randomly) into the genome using an “Is” label (e.g. muIs35).\n392       A.

The reporters are named for specific laboratories similar to mutant alleles, and they are further named according to whether the reporter gene is maintained extrachromosomally on a multicopy array using an “Ex” label (e.g. evEx1) or is maintained by integrating the sequence (in most cases randomly) into the genome using an “Is” label (e.g. muIs35).\n\n392 A.

In    addition,       the     ability     to   freeze      and      recover\nC. elegans        makes it possible to preserve mutant strains\nwithout worrying that they have acquired unwanted sup-\npressors, other modiﬁers, or additional background muta-\ntions or have lost important mutations, particularly if they\nare maintained as heterozygotes. Therefore, much less ef-\nfort needs to be devoted to strain maintenance.\n     The traditional use of genetics in C. elegans (often referred\nto as “forward genetics”) begins with a screen or selection to\nﬁnd mutants with a particular phenotype followed by infer-\nence of the wild-type role of the gene from the nature of\nthe mutant phenotype. Jorgensen and Mango (2002) have\nreviewed the many types of screens and selections used in\nC. elegans to identify mutations resulting in novel phenotypes\n(including conditional phenotypes) and mutations that mod-\nify (either enhancing or suppressing) existing phenotypes. A\nvariety of mutagens have been used (Kutscher and Shaham\n2014), including ethane methylsulfonate (EMS), an alkylat-\ning reagent that causes principally GC-to-AT transition\nmutations and small deletions, used by Brenner in his\ninitial studies (Brenner 1974).\n     Once mutant strains have been obtained and shown to\nbe true-breeding,             i.e., give mutant individuals in the next\ngeneration,         they     can     be    mapped         using     classical      genetic\ntools (Brenner 1974). Originally, mapping involved linkage\ncrosses to identify the chromosome containing the mutation\nfollowed by multiple three-factor crosses to reﬁne its map\nposition. Once a map position had been determined, the\nmutated gene could be identiﬁed molecularly (using the\nphysical map of overlapping genomic clones) by transforma-\ntion rescue of the mutant phenotype by the wild-type gene\n(Evans 2006; Merritt               et al.    2010; Schweinsberg and Grant\n2013). Transformation requires injection of DNA into the\nsyncytial (multinucleated) gonad, where it is incorporated\ninto the nucleus of some developing gametes (Mello and\nFire 1995). Transposon-tagged mutations were also used\nto isolate the DNA of the mutated gene, allowing for its\nmolecular identiﬁcation (e.g., Greenwald 1985). The entire\nprocess of cloning a gene could easily take a year.\n     Today, however, the process of connecting a mutant\nphenotype to a gene is much more rapid due to advances\nin whole-genome sequencing (Doitsidou et al. 2010; Zuryn\net al. 2010; Minevich et al. 2012). Mutants derived from the\nstandard wild-type strain (called N2) are crossed to a wild-\ntype strain obtained in Hawaii (CB4856), whose sequence\ndiffers from N2 at many positions [one single nucleotide\npolymorphism (SNP) per 91                       6 56 kb; Swan             et al.    2002].\nMutants reisolated after the cross have retained N2 sequen-\nces in the vicinity of the mutation, whereas N2 and Hawaiian\nsequences randomly segregate at other loci. Whole-genome\nsequencing can reveal the location of N2 DNA and lead,\nhopefully, to a small number of candidate genes that can\nbe tested as above. This process can be done in a number\n\nof weeks and, as before, transformation rescue (or comple-\nmentation testing) provides evidence that the correct gene\nhas been identiﬁed.\n    Researchers can also use a known gene sequence to\nobtain mutant strains, a process called                           “reverse genetics”\n(Ahringer 2006). One of the                     ﬁrst ways to do such reverse\ngenetics was the generation of strains that deleted all or part\nof a target gene (Lesa 2006). Animals were mutagenized\nwith trimethylpsoralen to cause deletions and large numbers\nof individual F2 animals were used to establish lines. Pool-\ning DNA from these strains and amplifying the several pools\nof DNA with PCR primers, designed to amplify a deleted but\nnot wild-type gene, could identify which line had a deletion\nmutation (a process called sibling selection). Further selec-\ntion within the line could establish a homozygous strain\ncontaining the deletion mutation.\n    Whole-genome sequencing has enabled a very rapid way\nof obtaining mutations. In a study dubbed the “million mu-\ntation project”         (Thompson et al.             2013), animals were mu-\ntated by EMS and/or N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) and F2\nprogeny (from different P0 parents) were grown. Over 2000\nhealthy strains were established from these mutageneses.\nWhole-genome sequencing of each strain showed that, on\naverage, there were 400 mutations per strain. Altogether\nthese strains had over 800,000 unique mutations. Since\nthe genome contains                 20,000 genes, each gene has been\nmutated an average of eight times. The results are available\nin WormBase and the strains can be obtained from the Cae-\nnorhabditis        Genetics        Center       (Table      1).    Recent       advances\nin efﬁcient genome-editing methods (TALEN and CRISPR/\nCas9) in       C. elegans        now allow investigators to create tar-\ngeted mutations in nearly any location in the genome in\nany genetic background (Frøkjær-Jensen 2013; Waaijers\nand Boxem 2014). These gene editing techniques, particu-\nlarly CRISPR/Cas9, enable rapid methods to mutate and\ninterrogate        C. elegans       genes, and new approaches based\non them are being introduced.\n    Mutant-like phenotypes can also be obtained using RNA\ninterference (RNAi), the use of double-stranded RNA\n(dsRNA) to reduce gene activity (Fire                              et al.     1998, see\nAhringer 2006). The added discovery that RNAi can be pro-\nduced       by    soaking       the    animals        in   a   solution       of    dsRNA\n(Tabara et al. 1998) or by feeding the animals bacteria that\ngenerate speciﬁc dsRNA (Timmons and Fire 1998) means\nthe entire genome can be easily and systematically interro-\ngated for genes needed for speciﬁc functions. Such genome-\nwide screens using libraries of bacterial strains are common\nand easily done.\n\nWhy Choose              C. elegans?\n\nIn addition to being a powerful system for genetic studies,\nC. elegans        has many inherent advantages as a model for\neukaryotic biology. These features include its small size,\nlarge brood size, ease of cultivation, low maintenance ex-\npense, long-term cryopreservation, quick generation time,\n                                                                           Primer        393",

Once a map position had been determined, the mutated gene could be identified molecularly (using the physical map of overlapping genomic clones) by transformation rescue of the mutant phenotype by the wild-type gene (Evans 2006; Merritt et al. 2010; Schweinsberg and Grant 2013). Transformation requires injection of DNA into the syncytial (multinucleated) gonad, where it is incorporated into the nucleus of some developing gametes (Mello and Fire 1995). Transposon-tagged mutations were also used to isolate the DNA of the mutated gene, allowing for its molecular identification (e.g., Greenwald 1985). The entire process of cloning a gene could easily take a year.\n\nToday, however, the process of connecting a mutant phenotype to a gene is much more rapid due to advances in whole-genome sequencing (Doitsidou et al. 2010; Zuryn et al. 2010; Minevich et al. 2012). Mutants derived from the standard wild-type strain (called N2) are crossed to a wild-type strain obtained in Hawaii (CB4856), whose sequence differs from N2 at many positions [one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) per 91 656 kb; Swan et al. 2002]. Mutants reisolated after the cross have retained N2 sequences in the vicinity of the mutation, whereas N2 and Hawaiian sequences randomly segregate at other loci. Whole-genome sequencing can reveal the location of N2 DNA and lead, hopefully, to a small number of candidate genes that can be tested as above. This process can be done in a number of weeks and, as before, transformation rescue (or complementation testing) provides evidence that the correct gene has been identified.\n\nResearchers can also use a known gene sequence to obtain mutant strains, a process called “reverse genetics” (Ahringer 2006). One of the first ways to do such reverse genetics was the generation of strains that deleted all or part of a target gene (Lesa 2006). Animals were mutagenized with trimethylpsoralen to cause deletions and large numbers of individual F2 animals were used to establish lines. Pooling DNA from these strains and amplifying the several pools of DNA with PCR primers, designed to amplify a deleted but not wild-type gene, could identify which line had a deletion mutation (a process called sibling selection). Further selection within the line could establish a homozygous strain containing the deletion mutation.\n\nWhole-genome sequencing has enabled a very rapid way of obtaining mutations. In a study dubbed the “million mutation project” (Thompson et al. 2013), animals were mutated by EMS and/or N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) and F2 progeny (from different P0 parents) were grown. Over 2000 healthy strains were established from these mutageneses. Whole-genome sequencing of each strain showed that, on average, there were 400 mutations per strain. Altogether these strains had over 800,000 unique mutations. Since the genome contains 20,000 genes, each gene has been mutated an average of eight times. The results are available in WormBase and the strains can be obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (Table 1). Recent advances in efficient genome-editing methods (TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9) in C. elegans now allow investigators to create targeted mutations in nearly any location in the genome in any genetic background (Frøkjær-Jensen 2013; Waaijers and Boxem 2014). These gene editing techniques, particularly CRISPR/Cas9, enable rapid methods to mutate and interrogate C. elegans genes, and new approaches based on them are being introduced.\n\nMutant-like phenotypes can also be obtained using RNA interference (RNAi), the use of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to reduce gene activity (Fire et al. 1998, see Ahringer 2006). The added discovery that RNAi can be produced by soaking the animals in a solution of dsRNA (Tabara et al. 1998) or by feeding the animals bacteria that generate specific dsRNA (Timmons and Fire 1998) means the entire genome can be easily and systematically interrogated for genes needed for specific functions. Such genome-wide screens using libraries of bacterial strains are common and easily done.",
          "md": "days at 20°) to develop from fertilized eggs to adults producing their own fertilized eggs, mutant homozygotes can be detected two generations (1 week) after mutagenesis. In addition, the ability to freeze and recover C. elegans makes it possible to preserve mutant strains without worrying that they have acquired unwanted suppressors, other modifiers, or additional background mutations or have lost important mutations, particularly if they are maintained as heterozygotes. Therefore, much less effort needs to be devoted to strain maintenance.\n\nThe traditional use of genetics in C. elegans (often referred to as “forward genetics”) begins with a screen or selection to find mutants with a particular phenotype followed by inference of the wild-type role of the gene from the nature of the mutant phenotype. Jorgensen and Mango (2002) have reviewed the many types of screens and selections used in C. elegans to identify mutations resulting in novel phenotypes (including conditional phenotypes) and mutations that modify (either enhancing or suppressing) existing phenotypes.

Al-\nthough not usually mentioned, another favorable feature of\nC. elegans is the organisms are quite benign to humans. In\nfact, because they cannot grow at body temperature, they\ncannot grow in humans. Some nematodes, e.g., Ascaris suum,\ninduce a debilitating allergic reaction and must be studied in\nventilated hoods (Kennedy 2013; A. O. Stretton, personal\ncommunication). As far as we are aware, allergic reactions\nto C. elegans have not been documented.\n    Studies of cell and developmental biology that use\nC. elegans      are greatly aided by the transparency of the\nanimal, which allows researchers to examine development\nand changes due to mutations or altered environments at\nthe level of a single, identiﬁed cell within the context of the\nentire living organism. Thus, many biological problems can\nbe studied     “in miniature” at the single-cell level, instead of\nin large numbers of cells in heterogeneous tissues. Trans-\nparency also enables a wealth of studies in living animals\nutilizing ﬂuorescent protein reporters (Figure 1D and Figure\n4B). By labeling cells and proteins in living cells, ﬂuorescent\nproteins enable genetic screens to identify mutants defec-\ntive in various cellular processes. In addition, ﬂuorescent\nprotein-based reporters (e.g., Cameleon and gCaMP3; Figure\n4C), which       ﬂuoresce in response to calcium                 ﬂux, provide\nneuron-speciﬁc detection of calcium              ﬂux under a        ﬂuorescent\nmicroscope and therefore allow researchers to measure electro-\nphysiological activity in vivo (Kerr 2006). Furthermore, mapping\nof cell–cell and synaptic contacts can be accomplished by\nexpressing complementary fragments of GFP in different cells\n(GRASP; Feinberg et al. 2008). Transparency also means that\noptogenetic tools, which alter the activity of individual neurons,\nare particularly effective in C. elegans (Husson et al. 2013). In all\nof these experiments, greater control of the animal’s position\nand environment can be accomplished by microﬂuidic devices\nin which individual worms are mounted in custom-designed\nchannels allowing the application of various compounds or\nother agents while simultaneously monitoring ﬂuorescent read-\nout of gene regulation or electrophysiological activity by mi-\ncroscopy (Lockery 2007; San-Miguel and Lu 2013).\n    Sharing large amounts of genetic and cellular informa-\ntion has been central to the success of                C. elegans     research.\nThe wealth of knowledge generated by past research is read-\nily available to anyone via on-line resources (see Table 1).\nMuch of this information, including gene expression, gene\nfunction, and references, is curated on WormBase (www.\nwormbase.org).

Researchers also have investigated a variety of behaviors, both simple and complex, including chemotaxis, thermotaxis, several responses to touch, male-specific mating rituals, social feeding, and both associative and nonassociative learning (Bargmann 2006; Hart 2006; Barr and Garcia 2006; Ardiel and Rankin 2010; Figure 4E). C. elegans also experiences periods of restful inactivity that are similar to aspects of mammalian sleep (Raizen et al. 2008).\n\nThe nervous system of the adult hermaphrodite has 302 neurons (Sulston and Horvitz 1977; White et al. 1986); that of the adult male has 383 neurons (Figure 4; WormAtlas.org). The majority of neuronal cell bodies are arranged in a few ganglia in the head, in the ventral cord, and in the tail (the specialized male tail has the majority of the extra neurons). Most of the neurons have a simple structure with one or two neurites (or processes) exiting from the cell body, but a few cells, such as the FLP and PVD mechanosensory neurons, have elaborately branched neurites (Dong et al. 2013). Except for sensory dendrites, which are often easy to identify, most neurites cannot be distinguished as axons or dendrites because they both give and receive synapses (although they are often referred to as “axons”). The neurites form synapses to each other in four major areas: the nerve ring (which encircles the pharynx), the ventral nerve cord, the dorsal nerve cord, and the neuropil of the tail. In addition to neurons, C. elegans has several glia-like support cells, which are primarily associated with sensory neurons, but are not as numerous as in vertebrates (Oikonomou and Shaham 2011).\n\nNerve conduction in C. elegans appears to be primarily passive. No sodium-dependent action potentials have been detected in neurons (Goodman et al. 1998) and the genome has no genes for voltage-gated sodium channels (Bargmann 1998). The absence of action potentials may be due to the very high membrane resistance. Indeed, many neurons are essentially isopotential; changes in voltage are experienced virtually instantaneously by the entire cell (Goodman et al. 1998), so action potentials may not be necessary (Lockery and Goodman 2009). Neurons express a wide variety of ion channels (Hobert 2013), including an unexpectedly large number of genes encoding potassium channels (Salkoff et al. 2005).\n\nC. elegans neurons make more than 7000 chemical synapses and gap junction connections (White et al. 1986). Unlike in vertebrate nervous systems, C. elegans neurons do not send terminal branches with boutons to make synapses. Most of the connections are made en passant (side by side as neurites pass each other), although many bilaterally symmetrical neurons join their tips together with gap junctions at the midline and some motor neurons similarly join with homologs end to end. Nematodes are unusual in that motor neurons do not send processes that synapse onto muscle; instead muscles send cellular projections to motor neurons to receive synapses. Chemical synapses are identified in electron micrographs by presynaptic darkening and synaptic vesicles; postsynaptic specializations are not obvious (Figure 4D). C. elegans uses many of the most common neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, glutamate, g-amino butyric acid (GABA), dopamine, and serotonin and has several receptors for their detection (Hobert 2013). Gap junctions are detected in electron micrographs as parallel membranes in the closely apposed neurons. As with other invertebrates, gap junctions are formed from innexins (Starich et al. 2001).\n\nIn addition to the chemical synaptic and gap junction connections, C. elegans neurons are modulated by numerous neuroendocrine signals (Li and Kim 2008).",

Researchers also have investigated a variety of behaviors, both simple and complex, including chemotaxis, thermotaxis, several responses to touch, male-specific mating rituals, social feeding, and both associative and nonassociative learning (Bargmann 2006; Hart 2006; Barr and Garcia 2006; Ardiel and Rankin 2010; Figure 4E). C. elegans also experiences periods of restful inactivity that are similar to aspects of mammalian sleep (Raizen et al. 2008).\n\nThe nervous system of the adult hermaphrodite has 302 neurons (Sulston and Horvitz 1977; White et al. 1986); that of the adult male has 383 neurons (Figure 4; WormAtlas.org). The majority of neuronal cell bodies are arranged in a few ganglia in the head, in the ventral cord, and in the tail (the specialized male tail has the majority of the extra neurons). Most of the neurons have a simple structure with one or two neurites (or processes) exiting from the cell body, but a few cells, such as the FLP and PVD mechanosensory neurons, have elaborately branched neurites (Dong et al. 2013). Except for sensory dendrites, which are often easy to identify, most neurites cannot be distinguished as axons or dendrites because they both give and receive synapses (although they are often referred to as “axons”). The neurites form synapses to each other in four major areas: the nerve ring (which encircles the pharynx), the ventral nerve cord, the dorsal nerve cord, and the neuropil of the tail. In addition to neurons, C. elegans has several glia-like support cells, which are primarily associated with sensory neurons, but are not as numerous as in vertebrates (Oikonomou and Shaham 2011).\n\nNerve conduction in C. elegans appears to be primarily passive. No sodium-dependent action potentials have been detected in neurons (Goodman et al. 1998) and the genome has no genes for voltage-gated sodium channels (Bargmann 1998). The absence of action potentials may be due to the very high membrane resistance. Indeed, many neurons are essentially isopotential; changes in voltage are experienced virtually instantaneously by the entire cell (Goodman et al. 1998), so action potentials may not be necessary (Lockery and Goodman 2009). Neurons express a wide variety of ion channels (Hobert 2013), including an unexpectedly large number of genes encoding potassium channels (Salkoff et al. 2005).\n\nC. elegans neurons make more than 7000 chemical synapses and gap junction connections (White et al. 1986). Unlike in vertebrate nervous systems, C. elegans neurons do not send terminal branches with boutons to make synapses. Most of the connections are made en passant (side by side as neurites pass each other), although many bilaterally symmetrical neurons join their tips together with gap junctions at the midline and some motor neurons similarly join with homologs end to end. Nematodes are unusual in that motor neurons do not send processes that synapse onto muscle; instead muscles send cellular projections to motor neurons to receive synapses. Chemical synapses are identified in electron micrographs by presynaptic darkening and synaptic vesicles; postsynaptic specializations are not obvious (Figure 4D). C. elegans uses many of the most common neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, glutamate, g-amino butyric acid (GABA), dopamine, and serotonin and has several receptors for their detection (Hobert 2013). Gap junctions are detected in electron micrographs as parallel membranes in the closely apposed neurons. As with other invertebrates, gap junctions are formed from innexins (Starich et al. 2001).\n\nIn addition to the chemical synaptic and gap junction connections, C. elegans neurons are modulated by numerous neuroendocrine signals (Li and Kim 2008).",

Wild-type animals (WT) are ap-\nproximately 1 mm long with a smooth exterior, and they move in a sinu-\nsoidal pattern. Rolling (Rol) animals twist their body like a corkscrew and\nas a result often remain in the same region moving in a circular pattern.\nDumpy (Dpy) animals are shorter than wild type. Multivulvae (Muv) her-\nmaphrodites have protrusions along the ventral side (white arrowheads)\nwhere vulvae form but are not able to attach to the uterus. Strain sources:\nD. Eisenmann and A. Golden.\n\nperspective of cellular and molecular detail, most of the\nproblems of neurobiology can be studied in the worm.\n   In C. elegans, some individual neurons perform functions\nthat would be performed by multiple neurons in vertebrates.\nFor example, individual olfactory neurons express multiple\nG protein-coupled odorant receptors (Troemel et al.                  1995;\nWes and Bargmann 2001), rather than a single receptor as\nin vertebrates; each of the two mirror image bilateral ASE\nchemosensory cells respond to several different ions (Hobert\n2010); and the connectivity of the touch receptor neurons\nsuggests that their stimulation initiates several different ac-\ntivities (Chalﬁe et al. 1985). Thus, functions of multiple ver-\ntebrate sensory neurons are compressed into a single neuron\nin C. elegans. This multifunctionality (or “polymodality”) may\nbe an evolutionary consequence of the small number of\nneurons in the C. elegans nervous system. Alternatively, multi-\nfunctionality may reﬂect a general feature of nervous systems\nthat was revealed by the ability to do detailed single-cell\nanalyses with this animal.\nReproductive tissue—sex-speciﬁc anatomy\n\nThe C. elegans sexes display several obvious anatomical dif-\nferences in the somatic gonad, secondary sexual structures,\nand body size (Figure 2, Figure 3, A and B). The somatic\ngonad is located in the center of the body alongside the\nintestine. In hermaphrodites the gonad consists of two\nmirror-image U-shaped tubes; in males the gonad consists of\na single U-shaped lobe (Figure 3). Both gonads house the\ngermline where the oocytes and sperm develop (Hubbard\nand Greenstein 2005). The somatic gonad and the germline\ndevelop together during larval stages until animals reach\nmaturity at the young adult stage. A powerful advantage\nfor studies of the C. elegans germline is that one can observe\nall stages of meiosis at once as the germline is a visible\ngradient of development (Hubbard and Greenstein 2005;\nKimble and Crittenden 2005; Figure 5B). Studying the\ngermline has been a model for meiosis, gamete develop-\nment, fertilization, stem cell biology, and even tumor forma-\ntion (Kimble and Crittenden 2005).\n    Secondary       sexual   mating     structures     are  the   vulva    in\nhermaphrodites and the fan-shaped tail in males (Emmons\n2005; Herman 2006). The vulva develops in the center of\nthe epidermis on the ventral side of the hermaphrodite and\nis the conduit for sperm entry from the male and egg laying\nfrom the uterus (Sternberg 2005). Studying vulval morpho-\ngenesis has provided insights into signaling by the Notch,\nEGF, and Wnt pathways that coordinate the spatiotemporal\ndevelopment of the organ. Defects in these pathways can\nlead to animals with no vulva [the egg-laying defective\n(Egl) phenotype] or with many vulval-like protrusions\n[the multivulva (Muv) phenotype; Figure 6]. In many\ncases these animals cannot lay eggs (or mate), and their\nprogeny develop internally, hatch within the hermaphro-\ndite, and create the         “bag-of-worms”        phenotype whereby\n\nthe larvae consume the mother (a process called endoto-\nkia matricidia). This phenotype, which also occurs when\nwild-type      adult    hermaphrodites         are   starved,    has   been\nused to identify numerous egg-laying defective mutants.\nFor example, details of Ras GTPase/MAP Kinase signaling\nhave been elucidated through the identiﬁcation of mutants\nin enhancer/suppressor screens of vulval phenotypes (Sundaram\n2013).\n    Adult males are thinner than hermaphrodites (due to\ntheir smaller gonad and the absence of developing em-\nbryos), and their tails are         ﬂattened into a fan of cuticular\nmaterial     with 18 projections          of  neurons and associated\nsupport cells called rays (Figure 3B). As with vulval develop-\nment, the development of male tail structures and their asso-\nciated muscles involves the coordinated action of multiple\nsignaling pathways (Emmons 2005). Interestingly, the same\nsignaling pathways are used in both males and hermaphro-\ndites in the development of reproductive tissues (e.g., Wnt\nsignaling), yet these pathways produce very different sex-\nspeciﬁc organs and structures (Emmons 2005).\n    The outward morphology of males and hermaphrodites\nis determined by a regulatory cascade that controls the\ntranscription factor TRA-1 (Zarkower 2006). The activity of\nTRA-1 depends on the X-to-autosome (or X:A) ratio. In\nmales, TRA-1 is inactive and leads to male fate and the\nproduction of sperm. In hermaphrodites, TRA-1 is active\nand leads to a female somatic fate and the formation of\nfemale gametes. C. elegans also has a dosage compensation\nsystem that downregulates expression of genes on the\nX-chromosome in hermaphrodites to equalize X-linked ex-\npression between the sexes. A sex-speciﬁc dosage compensa-\ntion complex, analogous to the chromatin condensin complex\nused in mitosis and meiosis, decorates the X chromosomes in\nhermaphrodites and downregulates X-linked genes by 50% to\nequal the gene expression from the single X chromosome in\nmales (Meyer 2005).\n\n               398      A.

Multivulvae (Muv) hermaphrodites have protrusions along the ventral side (white arrowheads) where vulvae form but are not able to attach to the uterus. Strain sources: D. Eisenmann and A. Golden.\n\n# Reproductive tissue—sex-specific anatomy\n\nThe C. elegans sexes display several obvious anatomical differences in the somatic gonad, secondary sexual structures, and body size (Figure 2, Figure 3, A and B). The somatic gonad is located in the center of the body alongside the intestine. In hermaphrodites the gonad consists of two mirror-image U-shaped tubes; in males the gonad consists of a single U-shaped lobe (Figure 3). Both gonads house the germline where the oocytes and sperm develop (Hubbard and Greenstein 2005). The somatic gonad and the germline develop together during larval stages until animals reach maturity at the young adult stage. A powerful advantage for studies of the C. elegans germline is that one can observe all stages of meiosis at once as the germline is a visible gradient of development (Hubbard and Greenstein 2005; Kimble and Crittenden 2005; Figure 5B). Studying the germline has been a model for meiosis, gamete development, fertilization, stem cell biology, and even tumor formation (Kimble and Crittenden 2005).\n\nSecondary sexual mating structures are the vulva in hermaphrodites and the fan-shaped tail in males (Emmons 2005; Herman 2006). The vulva develops in the center of the epidermis on the ventral side of the hermaphrodite and is the conduit for sperm entry from the male and egg laying from the uterus (Sternberg 2005). Studying vulval morphogenesis has provided insights into signaling by the Notch, EGF, and Wnt pathways that coordinate the spatiotemporal development of the organ. Defects in these pathways can lead to animals with no vulva [the egg-laying defective (Egl) phenotype] or with many vulval-like protrusions [the multivulva (Muv) phenotype; Figure 6]. In many cases these animals cannot lay eggs (or mate), and their progeny develop internally, hatch within the hermaphrodite, and create the “bag-of-worms” phenotype whereby the larvae consume the mother (a process called endotoky matricidia). This phenotype, which also occurs when wild-type adult hermaphrodites are starved, has been used to identify numerous egg-laying defective mutants. For example, details of Ras GTPase/MAP Kinase signaling have been elucidated through the identification of mutants in enhancer/suppressor screens of vulval phenotypes (Sundaram 2013).\n\nAdult males are thinner than hermaphrodites (due to their smaller gonad and the absence of developing embryos), and their tails are flattened into a fan of cuticular material with 18 projections of neurons and associated support cells called rays (Figure 3B). As with vulval development, the development of male tail structures and their associated muscles involves the coordinated action of multiple signaling pathways (Emmons 2005). Interestingly, the same signaling pathways are used in both males and hermaphrodites in the development of reproductive tissues (e.g., Wnt signaling), yet these pathways produce very different sex-specific organs and structures (Emmons 2005).\n\nThe outward morphology of males and hermaphrodites is determined by a regulatory cascade that controls the transcription factor TRA-1 (Zarkower 2006). The activity of TRA-1 depends on the X-to-autosome (or X:A) ratio. In males, TRA-1 is inactive and leads to male fate and the production of sperm. In hermaphrodites, TRA-1 is active and leads to a female somatic fate and the formation of female gametes.

As sequence information from additional Caenorhabditis species as well as more distantly-related nematodes has become available in the past decade, the information from C. elegans has provided the basis for rich comparative genomics studies (Coghlan 2005). The entire C. elegans genome is 100 Mb (C. elegans Sequencing Consortium 1998) and has 20,444 protein-coding genes (WormBase release WS245, October 2014). Both C. elegans sexes contain five autosomal chromosomes named linkage group (LG) I, II, III, IV, and V and the X chromosome. Individual genes of C. elegans are arranged in conventional eukaryotic fashion with 5' untranslated regions, open reading frames (ORFs) containing exons and introns, and 3' untranslated regions. Compared to vertebrate genes, C. elegans genes are relatively small with the average gene size of 3 kb due primarily to the presence of very small introns (Spieth and Lawson 2006; C. elegans genes also have many normal-sized introns). The chromosomes do not contain traditional centromeres; during mitosis the microtubule spindle attaches to more than one position along the chromosome (these attachments are said to be holocentric or polycentric). In fact, a specific sequence does not seem to be required for attachment since extrachromosomal DNA-containing transgenes can be inherited throughout many cell divisions.\n\nThe C. elegans genome has two unusual aspects: most protein-coding mRNAs are trans-spliced and some genes are organized in operons (Blumenthal 2005). Trans-splicing is the addition of one of two 22-nucleotide leader sequences (SL1 and SL2) at the 5' end of mRNA. The leader sequence is believed to aid in translational initiation and, because SL1/2 sequences are known, can be used experimentally to identify the sequence at the 5' end of mRNAs. Some C. elegans mRNAs are formed from multigenic transcripts with the first mRNA spliced to SL1 and subsequent mRNAs to SL2. The genes that code for these transcripts are closely spaced together in tandem and are transcribed under the control of a single promoter.

In contrast, related species such as C. briggsae are considered “cosmopolitan” since they are found in many habitats (Kiontke and Sudhaus 2006).

Plant parasitic nematodes cause significant crop damage (billions of dollars each year; Kandoth and Mitchum 2013) and animal parasites devastate domesticated animals (including heartworm in dogs and cats; McCall et al. 2008). C. elegans has played a critical role in elucidating the mode of action of anthelmintic drugs (Holden-Dye and Walker 2014). C. elegans may also prove useful in identifying new strategies to reduce or alleviate the action of parasitic nematodes, particularly since the emergence of resistance to current drugs (Holden-Dye and Walker 2014).\n\n# Brief History of C. elegans Research and Key Discoveries\n\nIn Brenner’s original vision, detailed elucidation of the development and anatomy of C. elegans would serve as the foundation for the subsequent analysis of mutants. Both of these efforts were completed primarily at the LMB. The transparency of the animal allowed John Sulston, Robert Horvitz, Judith Kimble, David Hirsh, and Einhard Schierenberg to describe every cell division starting with the single-celled zygote and ending with the adult male and hermaphrodite (Sulston and Horvitz 1977; Kimble and Hirsh 1979; Sulston et al. 1980, 1983). These efforts produced the first and only entire cell lineage of any multicellular organism. During this time, John White, Sydney Brenner, Donna Albertson, Eileen Southgate, Sam Ward, and Nichol Thomson described the anatomy and connectivity of all 302 neurons of the adult hermaphrodite (Ward et al. 1975; Albertson and Thomson 1976; White et al. 1976, 1986). These projects set a standard for completeness in the understanding of the animal that has been a hallmark of C. elegans research. Such completeness was also seen in the sequencing of the C. elegans genome (C. elegans Genome Consortium 1998), the description of the wiring diagram of the adult male (Jarrell et al. 2012), and development of genome-wide feeding RNAi experiments (Fraser et al. 2000; Kamath et al. 2001).\n\nSydney Brenner, Robert Horvitz, and John Sulston were awarded the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in part for the significance of the lineage project as a platform for discovery of genes that orchestrated developmental decisions.\n\nSince work on C. elegans genetics began in earnest during the 1970s, this animal has proven fruitful for making general discoveries about cell and developmental biology (Table 2). These findings have helped us understand molecular genetic mechanisms in all animals. Evolution has maintained thousands of conserved genes that play similar, or in some cases nearly identical, functions in nematodes and other animals.\n\n400 A. K. Corsi, B. Wightman, and M.

      "text": "including humans (Carroll            et al.  2004). For example, the\nvertebrate apoptosis regulator Bcl-2 can functionally substi-\ntute for its      C. elegans     ortholog     ced-9   (Hengartner and\nHorvitz 1994). Thus, discoveries with direct relevance to\nunderstanding all animals were made possible by what ini-\ntially appeared to be an ambitious and esoteric undertaking\nto deﬁne in detail the structure and genetics of an appar-\nently simple animal.\n    Genetic screens in C. elegans have yielded a number of ﬁrst\ndiscoveries of genes and pathways that play important roles\nin all animals. These discoveries include key genes regulating\napoptosis (programmed cell death) (Hedgecock et al.                   1983;\nEllis and Horvitz 1986), the Ras and Notch signaling path-\nways (Priess 2005; Greenwald and Kovall 2013; Sundaram\n2013), synaptic function (Gengyo-Ando et al. 1993; Richmond\net al.   1999), axon pathﬁnding (Hedgecock                   et al.   1987,\n1990), longevity (Kenyon et al. 1993; Kimura et al. 1997),\nand developmental timing (the heterochronic genes) (Ambros\nand Horvitz 1984). The study of the heterochronic genes\nyielded the       ﬁrst small regulatory RNA, the microRNA\n(miRNA) product of the lin-4 gene (Lee et al. 1993). Robert\nHorvitz’s 2002 Nobel Prize was awarded in part to recognize\nthe broad signiﬁcance of the genetic mechanisms of apopto-\nsis, and Gary Ruvkun and Victor Ambros shared the 2008\nAlbert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in recogni-\ntion of the general importance of miRNA.\n    C. elegans researchers also made important technical dis-\ncoveries that were subsequently adapted and applied to\nother biological systems. For example, early gene-cloning\nefforts helped advance techniques for deﬁning and as-\nsembling overlapping (contiguous) clones from animal\ngenomes, which led to C. elegans being the ﬁrst metazoan to\nhave its entire genome sequenced in 1998 (C. elegans                     Ge-\nnome Consortium 1998). Some of these strategies were also\nemployed in early human genome sequencing efforts. An-\nother discovery that led to a novel technique with broad bi-\nological    impact    was    gene    silencing    by  RNA     interference\n(RNAi) (Fire      et al.  1998). This powerful technique allows\nresearchers working with many organisms to silence the ex-\npression of any gene and earned Andrew Fire and Craig Mello\nthe 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (Fire 2007;\nMello 2007). Finally, the development of green                 ﬂuorescent\nprotein (GFP) as a biological marker (Chalﬁe et al. 1994) for\nwhich Marty Chalﬁe shared the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemis-\ntry grew directly from his interest in characterizing gene ex-\npression in live (and transparent) C. elegans. Now GFP and\nother ﬂuorescent proteins are widely-used biological tools.\n\nThe    C. elegans      Community\n\nHaving mentioned all the biological reasons that                 C. elegans\nprovides outstanding opportunities to study biological ques-\ntions and all the achievements that past studies have accom-\nplished, we would be remiss if we did not mention one other\nreason why the          ﬁeld has     ﬂourished:     the community of\nC. elegans     researchers. Our       ﬁeld has had a long tradition\n402       A. K. Corsi, B. Wightman, and M. Chalﬁe\nof openness and sharing of reagents and ideas. This openness\nwas    ﬁrst encouraged by the publication of the                C. elegans\nnewsletter,     The Worm Breeder’s Gazette. The               Gazette   was\nstarted by Bob Edgar at the University of California, Santa\nCruz so     C. elegans    researchers could tell each other about\ntheir research. Often work was described in the                     Gazette\nmany months before it was ofﬁcially published. For exam-\nple, the ﬁrst description of GFP as a biological marker (in the\nOctober 1993 issue of the           Gazette) preceded the         “ofﬁcial”\npublication by 5 months (Chalﬁe             et al. 1994). The      Gazette,\nnow entirely online, is published as part of WormBook and is\nan excellent resource for new methods and helpful hints to\naid C. elegans research.\n    The    second     person     to  greatly    support    and    promote\na community spirit among C. elegans researchers was John\nSulston. When John began determining the physical map of\nthe C. elegans     genome with Alan Coulson, one of his goals\nwas to promote sharing. He did this by not having any in-\ndependent research of his own (taking away even a hint that\nhe   might     be  a   competitor)      and   by   providing     a  service\nwhereby any researcher could get large amounts of DNA\non either side of a cloned fragment or in the region of a map-\nped gene. As a result, researchers did not hoard their DNA\nbefore publication and investigators beneﬁted by having\nclones of entire genes. The mapping project was able to link\nthe physical (DNA) and genetic (recombination) maps. Con-\nsequently, several collaborations were initiated because sci-\nentists shared their data before publication (e.g., Savage\net al.   1989; Miller      et al.  1992). As the mapping project\nturned to the sequencing of the             C. elegans    genome, John\nmade sure that the openness continued; results of the se-\nquencing project were made available daily. This same ap-\nproach was used when John and Alan along with Bob\nWaterston and many others turned to sequencing the hu-\nman genome.\n    A  ﬁeld with many thousands of researchers cannot be as\nclosely associated as in the early days when virtually all\nresearchers knew one another because they were Sydney\nBrenner’s F1 and F2 progeny. Nonetheless, the                   C. elegans\nﬁeld continues to share resources and information. The many\nfree online resources (Table 1), the Caenorhabditis Genetics\nCenter, and the many large, community projects (e.g., Mod-\nEncode Project, National Bioresource Project for the Experi-\nmental Animal        C. elegans, and       C. elegans    Gene Knockout\nConsortium) show that the sharing spirit continues. This\nspirit and the general enthusiasm of             C. elegans    researchers\nare also evident at the biennial            C. elegans    and the many\nalternate-year special topics and local meetings.               C. elegans\nhas also proven a useful system for undergraduate and even\nhigh school education. The ﬁeld continues to grow and to\nshare.\n    Looking to the future, C. elegans will continue to be an\nimportant source of scientiﬁc discoveries. Many of the rea-\nsons for past successes will aid future research, especially\nthe ability to look at individual cells within the context of\nthe entire animal. Soon genome editing should generate",

These discoveries include key genes regulating apoptosis (programmed cell death) (Hedgecock et al. 1983; Ellis and Horvitz 1986), the Ras and Notch signaling pathways (Priess 2005; Greenwald and Kovall 2013; Sundaram 2013), synaptic function (Gengyo-Ando et al. 1993; Richmond et al. 1999), axon pathfinding (Hedgecock et al. 1987, 1990), longevity (Kenyon et al. 1993; Kimura et al. 1997), and developmental timing (the heterochronic genes) (Ambros and Horvitz 1984). The study of the heterochronic genes yielded the first small regulatory RNA, the microRNA (miRNA) product of the lin-4 gene (Lee et al. 1993). Robert Horvitz’s 2002 Nobel Prize was awarded in part to recognize the broad significance of the genetic mechanisms of apoptosis, and Gary Ruvkun and Victor Ambros shared the 2008 Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in recognition of the general importance of miRNA.\n\nC. elegans researchers also made important technical discoveries that were subsequently adapted and applied to other biological systems. For example, early gene-cloning efforts helped advance techniques for defining and assembling overlapping (contiguous) clones from animal genomes, which led to C. elegans being the first metazoan to have its entire genome sequenced in 1998 (C. elegans Genome Consortium 1998). Some of these strategies were also employed in early human genome sequencing efforts. Another discovery that led to a novel technique with broad biological impact was gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) (Fire et al. 1998). This powerful technique allows researchers working with many organisms to silence the expression of any gene and earned Andrew Fire and Craig Mello the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (Fire 2007; Mello 2007). Finally, the development of green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a biological marker (Chalfie et al. 1994) for which Marty Chalfie shared the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry grew directly from his interest in characterizing gene expression in live (and transparent) C. elegans. Now GFP and other fluorescent proteins are widely-used biological tools.\n\n# The C. elegans Community\n\nHaving mentioned all the biological reasons that C. elegans provides outstanding opportunities to study biological questions and all the achievements that past studies have accomplished, we would be remiss if we did not mention one other reason why the field has flourished: the community of C. elegans researchers. Our field has had a long tradition of openness and sharing of reagents and ideas. This openness was first encouraged by the publication of the C. elegans newsletter, The Worm Breeder’s Gazette. The Gazette was started by Bob Edgar at the University of California, Santa Cruz so C. elegans researchers could tell each other about their research. Often work was described in the Gazette many months before it was officially published. For example, the first description of GFP as a biological marker (in the October 1993 issue of the Gazette) preceded the “official” publication by 5 months (Chalfie et al. 1994). The Gazette, now entirely online, is published as part of WormBook and is an excellent resource for new methods and helpful hints to aid C. elegans research.\n\nThe second person to greatly support and promote a community spirit among C. elegans researchers was John Sulston. When John began determining the physical map of the C. elegans genome with Alan Coulson, one of his goals was to promote sharing. He did this by not having any independent research of his own (taking away even a hint that he might be a competitor) and by providing a service whereby any researcher could get large amounts of DNA on either side of a cloned fragment or in the region of a mapped gene. As a result, researchers did not hoard their DNA before publication and investigators benefited by having clones of entire genes. The mapping project was able to link the physical (DNA) and genetic (recombination) maps. Consequently, several collaborations were initiated because scientists shared their data before publication (e.g., Savage et al. 1989; Miller et al. 1992). As the mapping project turned to the sequencing of the C. elegans genome, John made sure that the openness continued; results of the sequencing project were made available daily. This same approach was used when John and Alan along with Bob Waterston and many others turned to sequencing the human genome.\n\nA field with many thousands of researchers cannot be as closely associated as in the early days when virtually all researchers knew one another because they were Sydney Brenner’s F1 and F2 progeny. Nonetheless, the C. elegans field continues to share resources and information. The many free online resources (Table 1), the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center, and the many large, community projects (e.g., ModEncode Project, National Bioresource Project for the Experimental Animal C. elegans, and C. elegans Gene Knockout Consortium) show that the sharing spirit continues. This spirit and the general enthusiasm of C. elegans researchers are also evident at the biennial C. elegans and the many alternate-year special topics and local meetings. C. elegans has also proven a useful system for undergraduate and even high school education. The field continues to grow and to share.\n\nLooking to the future, C. elegans will continue to be an important source of scientific discoveries. Many of the reasons for past successes will aid future research, especially the ability to look at individual cells within the context of the entire animal. Soon genome editing should generate.",
