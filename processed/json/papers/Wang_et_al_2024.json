It also provides valuable entry points for studying the development and plasticity of neuronal identity features. In the *Caenorhabditis elegans* nervous system, neurotransmitter identities have been largely assigned by expression pattern analysis of neurotransmitter pathway genes that encode neurotransmitter biosynthetic enzymes or transporters. However, many of these assignments have relied on multicopy reporter transgenes that may lack relevant *cis*-regulatory information and therefore may not provide an accurate picture of neurotransmitter usage. We analyzed the expression patterns of 16 CRISPR/Cas9-engineered knock-in reporter strains for all main types of neurotransmitters in *C. elegans* (glutamate, acetylcholine, GABA, serotonin, dopamine, tyramine, and octopamine) in both the hermaphrodite and the male. Our analysis reveals novel sites of expression of these neurotransmitter systems within both neurons and glia, as well as non-neural cells, most notably in gonadal cells. The resulting expression atlas defines neurons that may be exclusively neuropeptidergic, substantially expands the repertoire of neurons capable of co-transmitting multiple neurotransmitters, and identifies novel sites of monoaminergic neurotransmitter uptake. Furthermore, we also observed unusual co-expression patterns of monoaminergic synthesis pathway genes, suggesting the existence of novel monoaminergic transmitters. Our analysis results in what constitutes the most extensive whole-animal-wide map of neurotransmitter usage to date, paving the way for a better understanding of neuronal communication and neuronal identity specification in *C. elegans*.\n\n----"

                        "contents": "potentially modified in response to specific external factors (such as the environment) or internal factors (such as sexual identity or neuronal activity patterns).\n\nThe existence of complete synaptic wiring diagrams of the compact nervous system of male and hermaphrodite *Caenorhabditis elegans* nematodes raises questions about the molecular mechanisms by which individual neurons communicate with each other. *C. elegans* employs the main neurotransmitter systems that are used throughout the animal kingdom, including acetylcholine, glutamate, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and several monoamines (**Sulston et al., 1975; Horvitz et al., 1982; Loer and Kenyon, 1993; McIntire et al., 1993; Duerr et al., 1999; Lee et al., 1999; Duerr et al., 2001; Alkema et al., 2005; Duerr et al., 2008; Serrano-Saiz et al., 2013; Pereira et al., 2015; Gendrel et al., 2016; Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b; Figure 1A**). Efforts to map these neurotransmitter systems to individual cell types throughout the entire nervous system have a long history, beginning with the use of chemical stains that directly detected a given neurotransmitter (dopamine) (**Sulston et al., 1975**), followed by antibody staining of neurotransmitter themselves (serotonin and GABA) (**Horvitz et al., 1982; McIntire et al., 1993**) or antibody stains of biosynthetic enzymes or neurotransmitter vesicular transporters (acetylcholine and monoamines) (**Loer and Kenyon, 1993; Duerr et al., 1999; Duerr et al., 2001; Alkema et al., 2005; Duerr et al., 2008; see Figure 1A** for an overview of these enzymes and transporters).\n\nWhile these early approaches proved successful in revealing neurotransmitter identities, they displayed several technical limitations. Since neurotransmitter-synthesizing or -transporting proteins primarily localize to neurites, the cellular identity of expressing cells (usually determined by assessing cell body position) often could not be unambiguously established in several, particularly cell- and neurite-dense regions of the nervous system. One example concerns cholinergic neurons, which are defined by the expression of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter UNC-17/VAChT and choline acetyltransferase CHA-1/ChAT. While mainly neurite-localized UNC-17 and CHA-1 antibody staining experiments could identify a subset of cholinergic neurons (**Duerr et al., 2001; Duerr et al., 2008**), many remained unidentified (**Pereira et al., 2015**). In addition, for GABA-producing neurons, it became apparent that antibody-based GABA detection was dependent on staining protocols, leading to the identification of \u2018novel\u2019 anti-GABA-positive neurons, i.e., GABAergic neurons, more than 20 years after the initial description of GABAergic neurons (**McIntire et al., 1993; Gendrel et al., 2016**).\n\nAn alternative approach to mapping neurotransmitter usage has been the use of reporter transgenes. This approach has the significant advantage of allowing the fluorophore to either fill the entire cytoplasm of a cell or to be targeted to the nucleus, thereby facilitating neuron identification. However, one shortcoming of transgene-based reporter approaches is that one cannot be certain that a chosen genomic region, fused to a reporter gene, indeed contains all *cis*-regulatory elements of the respective locus. In fact, the first report that described the expression of the vesicular glutamate transporter EAT-4, the key marker for glutamatergic neuron identity, largely underestimated the number of *eat-4/VLGUT*-positive and, hence, glutamatergic neurons (**Lee et al., 1999**). The introduction of fosmid-based reporter transgenes has largely addressed such concerns, as these reporters, with their 30\u201350 Kb size, usually cover entire intergenic regions (**Sarov et al., 2012**). Indeed, such fosmid-based reporters have been instrumental in describing the supposedly complete *C. elegans* glutamatergic nervous system, defined by the expression of *eat-4/VGLUT* (**Serrano-Saiz et al., 2013**), as well as the supposedly complete set of cholinergic (**Pereira et al., 2015**) and GABAergic neurons (**Gendrel et al., 2016**).\n\nHowever, even fosmid-based reporters may not be the final word. In theory, they may still miss distal *cis*-regulatory elements. Moreover, the multicopy nature of transgenes harbors the risk of overexpression artifacts, such as the titrating of rate-limiting negative regulatory mechanisms. Also, RNAi-based silencing mechanisms triggered by the multicopy nature of transgenic reporter arrays have the potential to dampen the expression of reporter arrays (**Nance and Frokjaer-Jensen, 2019**). One way to get around these limitations, while still preserving the advantages of reporter gene approaches, is to generate reporter alleles in which an endogenous locus is tagged with a reporter cassette, using CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering. Side-by-side comparisons of fosmid-based reporter expression patterns with those of knock-in reporter alleles indeed revealed several instances of discrepancies in expression patterns of homeobox genes (**Reilly et al., 2022**).\n\nAn indication that previous neurotransmitter assignments may not have been complete was provided by recent single-cell RNA (scRNA) transcriptomic analyses of the hermaphrodite nervous"

As we describe in this paper in more detail, transcripts for several neurotransmitter-synthesizing enzymes or transporters were detected in a few cells beyond those previously described to express the respective reporter genes. This motivated us to use CRISPR/Cas9 engineering to fluorescently tag a comprehensive panel of genetic loci that code for neurotransmitter-synthesizing, -transporting, and -uptaking proteins (\u2018neurotransmitter pathway genes\u2019). Using the landmark strain NeuroPAL for neuron identification (Yemini et al., 2021), we identified novel sites of expression of most neurotransmitter pathway genes. Furthermore, we used these reagents to expand and refine neurotransmitter maps of the entire nervous system of the *C. elegans* male, which contains almost 30% more neurons than the nervous system of the hermaphrodite yet lacks a reported scRNA transcriptome atlas. Together with the NeuroPAL cell-identification tool, these reporter alleles allowed us to substantially improve the previously described neurotransmitter map of the male nervous system (Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b). Our analysis provides insights into the breadth of usage of each individual neurotransmitter system, reveals instances of co-transmitter use, indicates the existence of neurons that may entirely rely on neuropeptides instead of classic neurotransmitters, reveals sexual dimorphisms in neurotransmitter usage, and suggests the likely existence of presently unknown neurotransmitters."

Additional neurons that we classify as GABAergic are those that do not synthesize GABA (*unc-25/GAD*-negative), but take up GABA from other neurons (based on anti-GABA antibody staining) and are expected to release GABA based on *unc-47/VGAT* expression (*Gendrel et al., 2016*). *unc-47/VGAT* expression without any evidence of GABA synthesis or uptake (*unc-25/GAD*- and anti-GABA-negative) is indicative of an unknown transmitter being present in these cells and utilizing *unc-47/VGAT* for vesicular secretion.\n\nd. **tph-1/TPH and bas-1/AAAD**: the co-expression of these two biosynthetic enzymes, together with the co-expression of the monoamine vesicular transporter *cat-1/VMAT*, defines all serotonin-synthesizing and -releasing neurons (*Figure 1A; Horvitz et al., 1982; Duerr et al., 1999; Sze et al., 2000; Hare and Loer, 2004*).\n\ne. **cat-2/TH and bas-1/AAAD**: the co-expression of these two biosynthetic enzymes, together with the co-expression of the monoamine vesicular transporter *cat-1/VMAT*, defines all dopamine-synthesizing and -releasing neurons (*Figure 1A; Sulston et al., 1975; Duerr et al., 1999; Lints and Emmons, 1999; Hare and Loer, 2004*).\n\nf. **tdc-1/TDC**: defines, together with *cat-1/VMAT*, all tyramine-synthesizing and -releasing neurons (*Figure 1A; Alkema et al., 2005*).\n\ng. **tbh-1/TBH**: expression of this gene, in combination with that of *tdc-1/TDC* and *cat-1/VMAT*, defines octopamine-synthesizing and -releasing neurons (*Figure 1A; Alkema et al., 2005*).\n\nh. **cat-1/VMAT**: expression of this vesicular monoamine transporter defines all four abovementioned monoaminergic neurons (serotonin, dopamine, tyramine, octopamine) (*Duerr et al., 1999*), but as described and discussed below, it may also define additional sets of monoaminergic neurons.\n\ni. **hdl-1/AAAD**: *hdl-1*, a previously uncharacterized gene, encodes the only other AAAD with sequence similarity to the *bas-1* and *tdc-1* AAAD enzymes that produce other bona fide"

In combination with the expression of *cat-1/VMAT*, which synaptically transports betaine (Hardege et al., 2022), *snf-3* expression may identify neurons that utilize betaine as a synaptically released neurotransmitter to gate betaine-gated ion channels, such as ACR-23 (Peden et al., 2013) or LGC-41 (Hardege et al., 2022).\n\nk. **mod-5/SERT**: this gene codes for the functionally validated ortholog of the vertebrate serotonin uptake transporter SERT (Ranganathan et al., 2001), which defines neurons that take up serotonin independently of their ability to synthesize serotonin and, depending on their expression of *cat-1/VMAT*, may either re-utilize serotonin for synaptic signaling or serve as serotonin clearance neurons.\n\nl. **oct-1/OCT**: this gene encodes the closest representative of the OCT subclass of SLC22 organic cation transporters (Zhu et al., 2015), several members of which are selective uptake transporters of tyramine (Breidert et al., 1998; Berry et al., 2016). Its expression or function in the nervous system had not previously been analyzed in *C. elegans*.\n\nFor all these 15 genetic loci, we compared scRNA transcriptome data from the CeNGEN scRNA atlas (at all four available stringency levels; Taylor et al., 2021) to previously published reporter and antibody staining data. As shown in *Figure 1B* and *Supplementary file 1*, such comparisons reveal the following:  \n- (a) scRNA data support the expression of genes in the vast majority of neurons in which those genes were found to be expressed with previous reporter gene approaches. In most cases, this is true even at the highest threshold levels for scRNA detection.  \n- (b) Vice versa, reporter gene expression supports scRNA transcriptome data for a specific neurotransmitter system in the great majority of cells.  \n- (c) In spite of this congruence, there were several discrepancies between reporter data and scRNA data. Generally, while valuable, scRNA transcriptome data cannot be considered the final word for any gene expression pattern assignments. Lack of detection of transcripts could be a sensitivity issue and, conversely, the presence of transcripts does not necessarily indicate that the respective protein is generated, due to the possibility of posttranscriptional regulation.\n\nHence, to consolidate and further improve neurotransmitter identity assignment throughout the entire *C. elegans* nervous system, and to circumvent potential limitations of multicopy, fosmid-based reporter transgenes on which previous neurotransmitter assignments have been based, we engineered and examined expression patterns of 16 knock-in reporter alleles of the 15 neurotransmitter synthesis, vesicular transport, and uptake loci listed above (*Figure 1, Figure 2*). For *unc-17* and *eat-4*, we knocked-in a `t2a::gfp::h2b (his-44)` cassette right before the stop codon of the respective gene. For *unc-25*, we created two knock-in alleles with the `t2a::gfp::h2b (his-44)` cassette tagging isoforms a.1/c.1 and b.1 separately. For *tdc-1*, a `gfp::h2b::t2a` cassette was knocked into the N-terminus of the locus because of different C-terminal splice variants. The self-cleaving T2A peptide frees up GFP::H2B, which will be transported to the nucleus, thereby facilitating cell identification. For *unc-46, unc-47, tph-1, bas-1, tbh-1, cat-1, cat-2, snf-3,* and *oct-1*, we knocked-in a `sl2::gfp::h2b` cassette at the C-terminus of the locus. The SL2 sequence also provides for the separate production of GFP::H2B. Both types of reporter cassettes should capture posttranscriptional, 3\u2019UTR-mediated regulation of each locus, e.g., by miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins (not captured by CeNGEN scRNA data). Since in each case the reporter is targeted to the nucleus, this strategy circumvents shortcomings associated with interpreting antibody staining patterns or dealing with too densely packed cytosolic signals. For *mod-5*, we analyzed a previously generated, non-nuclear reporter allele (Maicas et al., 2021). For all our neuronal cell identification, we utilized the neuronal landmark strain NeuroPAL (Tekieli et al., 2021; Yemini et al., 2021). The results of our neuronal expression pattern analysis are summarized in *Figure 3* and detailed in *Supplementary files 2 and 3*. In the ensuing sections we describe these patterns in detail."

The SL2- or T2A-based separation of the reporter from the coding sequence of the respective loci enables targeting of the reporter to the nucleus (via the H2B tag), which in turn facilitates the identification of the cell expressing a given reporter. Genome schematics are from WormBase (*Davis et al., 2022*). See *Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1* for *hdl-1* reporter alleles."

Variability  \ncould be due to one of the following reasons: (1) the endogenous gene is indeed expressed in some but not all animals; (2) the endogenous gene  \nis indeed expressed in every animal but the level of reporter expression is below detection threshold in some.

However, scRNA transcripts were detected at all four threshold levels in three additional neuron classes, RIC, PVN, and DVA, for which no previous reporter data provided support. In a recent publication, we had already described that the *eat-4* reporter allele syb4257 is expressed in RIC (*Reilly et al., 2022*) (confirmed in *Figure 4A*). We now also confirm expression of this reporter allele, albeit at low levels, in DVA and PVN (*Figure 4B, Supplementary file 2*).  \n\nAnother neuron found to have some *eat-4* transcripts, but only with the two lower threshold sets, is the I6 pharyngeal neuron. Consistent with our previous fosmid-based reporter data, we detected no I6 expression with our *eat-4(syb4257)* reporter allele. The *eat-4* reporter allele also shows expression in the pharyngeal neuron M5, albeit very weakly (*Figure 4A, Supplementary file 2*), consistent with CeNGEN scRNA data. Weak expression of the *eat-4* fosmid-based reporter in ASK and ADL remained weak, but clearly detectable with the *eat-4(syb4257)* reporter allele (*Figure 4A, Supplementary file 2*). Extremely dim expression in PHA can be occasionally detected. Whereas the PVQ neuron class displays *eat-4* scRNA transcripts and was reported to show very dim *eat-4* fosmid-based reporter expression, we detected no expression of the *eat-4(syb4257)* reporter allele in PVQ neurons (*Figure 4B, Supplementary file 2*). We also did not detect expression of *eat-4(syb4257)* in the GABAergic AVL and DVB neurons, in which a recent report describes expression of an *eat-4* promoter fusion reporter (*Li et al., 2023*). An absence of *eat-4(syb4257)* expression in AVL and DVB is also consistent with the absence of scRNA transcripts in these neurons.  \n\nA few neurons were found to express *eat-4* transcripts by the CeNGEN atlas, but only with lower threshold levels, including, for example, the RMD, PVM, and I4 neurons (*Figure 1B, Supplementary file 1*). We failed to detect reporter allele expression in RMD or PVM neurons, but occasionally observed very dim expression in I4. Lastly, we identified a novel site of *eat-4* expression in the dopaminergic PDE neuron (*Figure 4B, Supplementary file 2*). While such expression was neither detected with previous reporters nor scRNA transcripts, we detected it very consistently but at relatively low levels."

Expression in PVN is detected in both sexes but at a much higher level in the male.  \n**(C)** In the head, prominent expression of *unc-17*(syb4491) in RIP and dim expression in AWA and AFD neurons are detected. There is no visible expression in RIB, FLP, or AVJ. Consistent with previous reports, AIM expresses *unc-17* only in males and not hermaphrodites. In addition, very dim expression of AVG can be detected occasionally in hermaphrodites (representative image showing an animal with no visible expression) and slightly stronger in males (representative image showing an animal with visible expression).

The *unc-17*(syb4491) reporter allele confirmed weak but consistent expression in the PVN neurons as well as variable, borderline expression in AVG (**Figure 4C and D**). However, we failed to detect *unc-17*(syb4491) reporter allele expression in the RIB neurons.  \nWe detected another novel site of *unc-17* expression, albeit dim, in the glutamatergic AFD neurons (**Figure 4C, Supplementary file 2**). This expression was not reported with previous fosmid-based reporter or CeNGEN scRNA data. Consistent with AFD and PVN being potentially cholinergic, scRNA transcript reads for *cha-1/ChAT*, the ACh-synthesizing choline acetyltransferase, were also detected in AFD and PVN (**Supplementary file 1**).  \nLastly, another notable observation is the lack of any *unc-17* reporter expression or CeNGEN scRNA transcripts in the interneuron AVJ, but presence of CeNGEN scRNA transcript reads for *cha-1/ChAT* (**Supplementary file 1**), which shares exons with the *unc-17/VAChT* locus (Alfonso et al., 1994). Although no reporter data is available for *cha-1/ChAT*, such interesting mismatch between available *unc-17* and *cha-1/ChAT* expression data could provide a hint to potential non-vesicular cholinergic transmission in the AVJ neurons in *C. elegans*, potentially akin to reportedly non-vesicular release of acetylcholine in the visual system of *Drosophila* (Yang and Kunes, 2004)."

The CeNGEN scRNA atlas shows robust support for these assignments at all four threshold levels (**Figure 1B, Supplementary file 1**). *unc-25* scRNA signals (but no reporter signals) were detected at several orders of magnitude lower levels in three additional neuron classes (AWA, AVH, PVT), but only with the least robust threshold level.  \n\nIn this study we generated another *unc-25/GAD* reporter allele, using a t2a::gfp::h2b cassette (ot1372) (**Figure 2**). This allele showed the same expression pattern as the previously described SL2-based *unc-25*(ot867) reporter allele (**Figure 5A, Supplementary file 2**). This includes a lack of expression in a number of neurons that stain with anti-GABA antibodies (SMD, AVA, AVB, AVJ, ALA, and AVF) and GLR glia, corroborating the notion that these neurons and glia take up GABA from other cells (indeed, a subset of those cells do express the GABA uptake reporter SNF-11; Gendrel et al., 2016).  \n\nWe carefully examined potential *unc-25/GAD* reporter allele expression in the AMsh glia, which were reported to generate GABA through *unc-25/GAD* (Duan et al., 2020; Fernandez-Abascal et al., 2022). We did not detect visible *unc-25*(ot867) or *unc-25*(ot1372) reporter allele expression in AMsh, consistent with the failure to directly detect GABA in AMsh through highly sensitive anti-GABA staining (Gendrel et al., 2016).

In several of these neuron classes both the fosmid-based reporter and the CeNGEN scRNA data indicate very robust expression (e.g. AIN, SIA, SDQ), while in many others scRNA transcripts are only evident at looser thresholds and, correspondingly, fosmid-based reporter expression in these cells is often weak (*Supplementary file 1; Gendrel et al., 2016*). To investigate this matter further, we CRISPR/Cas9-engineered a *gfp*-based reporter allele for *unc-47*, syb7566, and first crossed it with an mCherry-based *unc-47* fosmid-based reporter (otIs564) as a first-pass assessment for any obvious overlaps and mismatches of expression patterns between the two (Figure 5B, left side panels). The vast majority of neurons exhibited overlapping expression between syb7566 and otIs564. There were also many notable similarities in the robustness of expression of the fosmid-based reporter and the reporter allele (*Supplementary file 1*). In a few cases where the fosmid-based reporter expression was so dim that it is only detectable via antibody staining against its fluorophore (mCherry) (*Gendrel et al., 2016; Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b*), the reporter allele expression was readily visible (*Supplementary file 1*).\n\nThe very few mismatches of expression of the fosmid-based reporter and the reporter allele included the pharyngeal neuron M1, which expresses no visible *unc-47*(syb7566) reporter allele but weak fosmid-based reporter expression, and the pharyngeal neuron I1, which expresses dim syb7566 but no fosmid-based reporter (Figure 5B, right side panels). AVJ shows very dim and variable *unc-47*(syb7566) reporter allele expression but no fosmid-based reporter expression. Since AVJ stains with anti-GABA antibodies (*Gendrel et al., 2016*), this neuron likely engages in vesicular release of GABA, even though its source of GABA remains unclear since it neither expresses conventional GABA synthesis machinery (UNC-25/GAD) nor GABA uptake machinery (SNF-11). Other neurons previously shown to stain with anti-GABA antibodies and to express the *unc-47* fosmid-based reporter (ALA and SMD) (*Gendrel et al., 2016*) still show expression of the *unc-47* reporter allele.\n\nIn addition, while the reporter allele of *unc-47/VGAT*, in conjunction with CeNGEN scRNA data, corroborates the notion that *unc-47/VGAT* is expressed in all GABA-synthesizing and most GABA uptake neurons, there is a substantial number of *unc-47*-positive neurons that do not show any evidence of GABA presence. This suggests that UNC-47/VGAT may transport another unidentified neurotransmitter (see Discussion) (*Gendrel et al., 2016*)."

In addition to these well-characterized sites of expression, several of the individual genes show scRNA-based transcripts in a few additional cells: *tph-1* at all four threshold levels in AFD and MI. Neither of these cells display scRNA transcripts for *bas-1/AAAD*, the enzyme that metabolizes the TPH-1 product 5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan) into serotonin (5-HT) (*Figure 1A*). To further investigate these observations, we generated reporter alleles for both *tph-1* and *bas-1* (*Figure 2*). Expression of the *tph-1* reporter allele *syb6451* confirmed expression in the previously well-described neurons that stained positive for serotonin, namely NSM, HSN, and ADF, matching CeNGEN data. While expression in AFD (seen at all four threshold levels in the CeNGEN scRNA atlas) could not be confirmed with the reporter allele, expression in the pharyngeal MI neurons could be confirmed (*Figure 6A, Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1, Supplementary file 2*).\n\nWe detected co-expression of the *bas-1* reporter allele, *syb5923*, with *tph-1(syb6451)* in NSM, HSN, and ADF, in accordance with the previous reporter and scRNA data (*Figure 6B, Supplementary file 2*). However, *bas-1(syb5923)* is not co-expressed with *tph-1* in MI (*Figure 6A and B*), nor is there CeNGEN-transcript evidence for *bas-1/AAAD* in MI (*Figure 1, Supplementary file 1*). Hence, TPH-1-synthesized 5-HTP in MI is not metabolized into 5-HT (serotonin), consistent with the lack of serotonin-antibody staining in MI (*Horvitz et al., 1982; Sze et al., 2000*).\n\nWe also detected *tph-1(syb6451)* reporter allele expression in the serotonergic VC4 and VC5 neurons (*Figure 6A, Supplementary file 2*), consistent with scRNA data (*Figure 1, Supplementary file 1*) and previous reporter transgene data (*Mondal et al., 2018*). This suggests that these neurons are capable of producing 5-HTP. However, there is no *bas-1(syb5923)* expression in VC4 or VC5, consistent with previous data showing that serotonin is taken up, but not synthesized by them (*Duerr et al., 2001*) (more below on monoamine uptake; *Tables 1 and 2*).\n\nAs expected from the role of *bas-1/AAAD* in dopamine synthesis (*Hare and Loer, 2004*), *bas-1(syb5923)* is also expressed in dopaminergic neurons PDE, CEP, and ADE. In addition, it is also expressed weakly in URB, consistent with scRNA data. We did not detect visible expression in PVW or PVT, both of which showed very low levels of scRNA transcripts (*Figure 1, Supplementary file 1*). Expression of *bas-1/AAAD* in URB may suggest that URB generates a non-canonical monoamine (e.g. tryptamine, phenylethylamine [PEA], or histamine), but since URB expresses no vesicular transporter (*cat-1/VMAT*, see below), we consider it unlikely that any such monoamine would be secreted via canonical vesicular synaptic release mechanisms."

As previously mentioned, we detected no `cat-1/VMAT` expression in the `tph-1/TPH`-positive MI or the `cat-2/TH`-positive OLL neurons.\n\nThe `cat-1/VMAT` reporter allele revealed expression in an additional neuron class, the AUA neuron pair (**Figure 6C, Supplementary file 2**). Expression in this neuron is not detected in scRNA data; however, such expression may be consistent with previous CAT-1/VMAT antibody staining data (Duerr *et al.*, 1999). These authors found the same expression pattern as we detected with `cat-1/VMAT` reporter allele, except for the AIM neuron, which Duerr *et al.* identified as CAT-1/VMAT antibody-staining positive. However, neither our reporter allele, nor a fosmid-based `cat-1/VMAT` reporter, nor scRNA data showed expression in AIM, and we therefore think that the neurons identified by Duerr *et al.* as AIM may have been the AUA neurons instead (see also *Serrano-Saiz et al.*, 2017b). Additionally, a `cat-1`-positive neuron pair in the ventral ganglion, unidentified but mentioned by Duerr *et al.*, 1999, is likely the tyraminergic RIM neuron pair, based on our reporter allele and CeNGEN scRNA data."

This matched the observations that RIH and AIM do not synthesize serotonin (i.e. do not express *tph-1*), but stain positive with a serotonin antibody (Jafari et al., 2011). In *mod-5* mutants or wild type worms treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (such as the SSRI fluoxetine), RIH and AIM lose serotonin immunoreactivity (Jafari et al., 2011). We analyzed a CRISPR-based reporter allele, *mod-5(vlc47)* (Maicas et al., 2021), and confirmed expression in the four neuron classes NSM, ADF, RIH, and AIM (Figure 8). Because only NSM, ADF, and RIH, but not AIM, express the reporter allele of the monoamine transporter *CAT-1/VMAT* (Figure 6), AIM likely functions as a serotonin uptake/clearance neuron (Tables 1 and 2; see also Discussion). In addition, we also detected dim *mod-5/SERT* expression in the phasmid neuron class PHA and very dim, variable signals in URX (Figure 8A, B, E) consistent with scRNA data (Supplementary file 1). The results for anti-serotonin-staining from previous reports are variable in a few neurons, possibly due to differences in staining methods (including URX, I5, VC4, VC5, and PVW; Loer and Kenyon, 1993; Rand and Nonet, 1997; Duerr et al., 1999; Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b). In light of its *mod-5/SERT* reporter expression, URX may acquire serotonin via *mod-5*, akin to AIM (Tables 1 and 2).\n\nIn the hermaphrodite-specific neurons HSN, VC4, and VC5, we did not observe expression of the *mod-5/SERT* reporter allele (Tables 1 and 2). Since VC4 and VC5 do not express the complete synthesis pathway for serotonin, we infer that the anti-serotonin staining in these neurons is a result of alternative serotonin uptake or synthesis mechanisms. A similar scenario holds for the pharyngeal neuron I5, which was previously reported to stain weakly for serotonin (Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b)."

We tagged the endogenous *oct-1* locus with an `sl2::gfp::h2b` cassette (syb8870) and, within the nervous system, observed exclusive expression in the RIM neuron (Figure 8H and I), indicating that RIM is likely capable of uptaking tyramine in addition to synthesizing it via *tdc-1/TDC*. This is consistent with RIM being the only neuron showing *oct-1* scRNA transcripts at all four threshold levels in the CeNGEN atlas (Supplementary file 1)."

Each dot represents a single animal. Expression is not sexually dimorphic for the reporter alleles of either the serotonin-synthesizing enzyme *tph-1* or the vesicular acetylcholine transporter *unc-17*. Expression was normalized against expression in other reporter-expressing neurons. Statistics, Mann-Whitney test.  \n**(G)** In the tail region of wild type males, male-specific neurons PGA, R1B, R3B, and R9B are stained positive for serotonin. In a *mod-5(n3314)* mutant background, staining is completely lost in PGA (41/41 stained animals) and significantly affected for R9B (completely lost in 31/41 animals and much dimmer in the rest), while it remains in all 41 stained animals for R1B and R3B. The staining for CP1 to CP6 are also not affected in *mod-5* mutant animals (remaining in 41/41 stained animals; image showing CP5 and CP6).  \n**(H, I)** In adult animals, *oct-1(syb8870)* is expressed in the tyraminergic neuron class RIM in both sexes. Expression is not observed in any other neurons.  \n**(J, K)** Outside the nervous system, *oct-1(syb8870)* is expressed in body wall muscle (BWM) throughout the worm (J) as well as hypodermal cells and selected head glia (K). Expression is also observed in gonadal cells in the male vas deferens (K). A pan-glial reporter *otIs870[mir-228p::3xnls::TagRFP]* and a *dpy-7p::mCherry* reporter *stIs10166 [dpy-7p::his-24::mCherry+unc-119(+)]* were used for glial and hypodermal identification, respectively. Scale bars, 10 \u03bcm.\n\n----\n\nRelease via CAT-1/VMAT. We considered the putative neurotransmitter betaine as a possible candidate, since CAT-1/VMAT is also able to package betaine (Peden et al., 2013; Hardege et al., 2022). Betaine is synthesized endogenously, within the nervous system mostly in the *cat-1/VMAT*-positive RIM neuron (Hardege et al., 2022), but it is also available in the bacterial diet of *C. elegans* (Peden et al., 2013). In vertebrates, dietary betaine is taken up by the betaine transporter BGT1 (aka SLC6A12). To test whether *cat-1/VMAT*-positive neurons may acquire betaine via BGT1-mediated uptake, we CRISPR/Cas9-engineered a reporter allele for *snf-3/BGT1*, syb7290. We detected expression in the betaine-synthesizing (and also tyraminergic) RIM neuron (**Figure 9, Tables 1 and 2**). In addition, *snf-3* is indeed expressed in all the four *cat-1/VMAT*-positive neuron classes that do not synthesize a previously known monoaminergic transmitter (CAN, AUA, and variably, RIR and ASI) (**Figure 9A and B**). These neurons may therefore take up betaine and synaptically release it via CAT-1/VMAT. The *snf-3(syb7290)* reporter allele is also expressed in the serotonergic neuron NSM (albeit variably) (**Tables 1 and 2**), thus NSM could also be a betaine uptake neuron. In addition, we also detected *snf-3(syb7290)* expression in several other neurons that do not express *cat-1(syb6486)* (**Supplementary file 1**). Expression was also observed in a substantial number of non-neuronal cell types (**Figure 9E\u2013G, Table 2, Supplementary file 1**). These neurons and non-neuronal cells may serve to clear betaine (see Discussion, Neurotransmitter synthesis versus uptake). *snf-3(syb7290)* is not expressed in the inner and outer labial neuron classes as previously suggested (Peden et al., 2013); these cells were likely misidentified in the previous study and are in fact inner and outer labial glial cells (as discussed further below).\n\nTogether with the expression pattern of the uptake transporters, all *cat-1/VMAT*-positive neurons in the hermaphrodite can be matched with an aminergic neurotransmitter. We nevertheless wondered whether another presently unknown monoaminergic transmitter, e.g., histamine or other trace amine, could be synthesized by a previously uncharacterized AAAD enzyme encoded in the *C. elegans* genome, *hdl-1* (**Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A; Hare and Loer, 2004**). We CRISPR/Cas9-engineered an *hdl-1* reporter allele, syb1048, but detected no expression of this reporter in the animal (**Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C and D**). Attempts to amplify weak expression signals by insertion of Cre recombinase into the locus failed [*hdl-1(syb4208)*] (see Materials and methods). CeNGEN scRNA data also shows no strong transcript expression in the hermaphrodite nervous system and only detected notable expression in sperm (Taylor et al., 2021).\n\n----"

Based on the expression of fosmid-based reporters, we had previously assembled a neurotransmitter atlas of the *C. elegans* male nervous system in which individual neuron classes are notoriously difficult to identify (Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b). We have since established a NeuroPAL landmark strain that permits more reliable identification of gene expression patterns in both the hermaphrodite and male-specific nervous system (Tekieli et al., 2021; Yemini et al., 2021). We used NeuroPAL to facilitate the analysis of the expression profiles of our CRISPR/Cas9-engineered reporter alleles in the male, resulting in updated expression profiles for 11 of the 16 knock-in reporter alleles analyzed. As in the hermaphrodite, reasons for these updates vary. In addition to the improved accuracy of neuron identification"

                        "contents": "We analyzed *eat-4*/VGLUT (syb4257), *unc-17*/VAChT (syb4491), *unc-25*/GAD (ot1372), and *unc-47*/VGAT (syb7566) expression in the male-specific nervous system using NeuroPAL landmark strains (otIs696 for *eat-4* and otIs669 for all others) (**Figures 10 and 11**). Of all those reporter alleles, *unc-25*/GAD (ot1372) was the only one with no updated expression. Specifically, in addition to confirming presence of expression of the *unc-25*(ot1372) reporter allele in CP9, EF1/2, EF3/4, we also confirmed its *lack* of expression in anti-GABA-positive neurons R2A, R6A, and R9B (Gendrel et al., 2016; Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b; **Figure 11A, Supplementary file 3**).\n\nIn the preanal ganglion, we observed weak expression of *unc-17*(syb4491) in DX3/4 (**Figure 10B, Supplementary file 3**), hence assigning previously unknown neurotransmitter identity to these neurons. Related to DX3/4, we also confirmed expression of *unc-17* in DX1/2 in the dorsorectal ganglion, consistent with fosmid-based reporter data (**Supplementary file 3; Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b**). In the lumbar ganglion, we detected novel expression of *unc-17*(syb4491) in five pairs of type B ray neurons, namely R1B, R4B, R5B, R7B, and R9B (**Figure 10B, Supplementary file 3**). Expression in all these neurons is low, possibly explaining why it is not observed with an *unc-17* fosmid-based reporter (Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b).\n\nIn the ventral nerve cord, we found additional, very weak expression of *eat-4*(syb4257) in CA1 to CA4 (**Figure 10A, Supplementary file 3**), as well as weak expression of *unc-17*(syb4491) in CP1 to CP4 (**Figure 10B, Supplementary file 3**), all undetected by previous analysis of fosmid-based reporters (Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b). Conversely, two neurons lack previously reported expression of fosmid-based reporters; CP9 does not show visible *unc-17*(syb4491) expression (**Figure 10B**) and neither does CA9 show visible expression of *unc-47*(syb7566) expression (**Figure 11C**). We also realized that the neuron identifications of CA7 and CP7 were previously switched (Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b), due to lack of proper markers for those two neurons. With NeuroPAL, we are now able to clearly distinguish the two and update their classic neurotransmitter reporter expression:  \n- CA7 expresses high levels of *eat-4*(syb4257) (**Figure 10A, Supplementary file 3**), very low levels of *unc-17*(syb4491) (**Figure 10B**), and no *unc-47*(syb7566) (**Figure 11C**);  \n- CP7 expresses no *eat-4*(syb4257) (**Figure 10A, Supplementary file 3**), very low levels of *unc-17*(syb4491) (**Figure 10B**), and very low levels of *unc-47*(syb7566) as well (**Figure 11C**).  \n\nTaken together, the analysis of reporter alleles reveals a remarkable diversity of CA and CP neurons, summarized in **Figure 10C**.\n\nIn the head, we detected expression of *unc-47*(syb7566) in the male-specific neuron class MCM (**Figure 11B, Supplementary file 3**), previously not observed with fosmid-based reporters. Consistent with fosmid-based reporter data, the other male-specific head neuron class, CEM, shows expression of *unc-17*(syb4491) (**Supplementary file 3**) and *unc-47*(syb7566) (**Figure 11B, Supplementary file 3**) reporter alleles."

Intriguingly, just as the sex-shared neuron AVL  \n(**Figure 6C**), these neurons express no other serotonergic, dopaminergic, tyraminergic, or octopami-  \nnergic pathway genes. However, we did find PDC (but not PVX or PVY) to express the betaine uptake  \ntransporter reporter allele *snf-3(syb7290)* (**Figure 9**; more below). PVX and PVY may synthesize or  \nuptake another aminergic transmitter. Such presumptive transmitter is not likely to be synthesized by  \n*hdl-1/AAAD* since we detected no expression of the *hdl-1* reporter allele *syb4208* in the male nervous  \nsystem.  \nThe expression pattern of the *bas-1/AAAD*, which had not been previously analyzed in the male-  \nspecific nervous system, reveals additional novelties. In addition to the \u2018canonical\u2019 serotonergic and  \ndopaminergic neurons described above, we detected *bas-1(syb5923)* reporter allele expression in a  \nsubstantial number of additional neurons, including the tyraminergic HOA and R7A neurons, but also  \nthe DVE, DVF, R2A, R3A, R6A, R8A, R2B, R6B, R7B, PCB, and SPC neurons (**Figure 12C, Supplemen-  \ntary file 3**). As described above, a subset of the neurons co-express *tbh-1(syb7786)* (most B-type  \nray neurons), a few co-express *tdc-1(syb7768)* (HOA and several A-type ray neurons), and several  \nco-express neither of these two genes. Only a subset of these neurons express *cat-1(syb6486)*. Taken  \ntogether, this expression pattern analysis argues for the existence of additional monoaminergic  \nsignaling system(s) (**Table 2**)."

Hence, like several other monoaminergic neurons, these  \nserotonergic neurons both synthesize, synaptically release, and reuptake serotonin. In contrast, anti-  \nserotonin staining is lost from the R9B and PGA neurons of *mod-5(n3314)* mutant animals, indicating  \nthat the presence of serotonin in these neurons depends on serotonin uptake, consistent with them  \nnot expressing the complete serotonin synthesis pathway (**Table 2; Supplementary file 3**). Since R9B  \nand PGA express *cat-1/VMAT* (**Figure 12A**), these neurons have the option to utilize serotonin for  \nvesicular release after *mod-5*-dependent uptake."

Since PVN is also cholinergic (Figure 4D; *Pereira et al., 2015*), this observation indicates a sexually dimorphic co-transmission configuration.  \nAs described above (Figure 4B, Supplementary file 2), our *eat-4* reporter allele revealed low levels of *eat-4/VGLUT* expression in hermaphrodites PVN, but in males the *eat-4* reporter allele showed strongly increased expression, compared to hermaphrodites. Hence, rather than being an \u2018on\u2019 vs. \u2018off\u2019 dimorphism, dimorphic *eat-4/VGLUT* expression in male PVN resembles the \u2018scaling\u2019 phenomenon we had described previously for *eat-4/VGLUT* in male PHC neurons, compared to hermaphrodite PHC neurons (*Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017a*). Both PHC and PVN display a substantial increase in the amount of synaptic output of these neurons in males compared to hermaphrodites (*Cook et al., 2019*), providing a likely explanation for such scaling of gene expression. The scaling of *eat-4/VGLUT* expression in PVN is not accompanied by scaling of *unc-17/VAChT* expression, which remains comparable in both sexes (Figure 4D).  \n\nWe also examined AIM, another neuron class that was previously reported to be sexually dimorphic in that AIM expresses *eat-4/VGLUT* fosmid-based reporters in juvenile stages in both sexes, whereas upon sexual maturation its neurotransmitter identity is switched from being glutamatergic to cholinergic only in adult males and not hermaphrodites (*Pereira et al., 2015; Pereira et al., 2019*). With the *eat-4(syb4257)* reporter allele, we also detected a downregulation of *eat-4* expression to low levels in young adult males and almost complete elimination in 2-day-old adult males, while expression in hermaphrodites stays high."

In all these cases expression was only detected in males and not hermaphrodites.

This suggests that the sex difference specifically involves serotonin signaling mechanisms, particularly serotonin uptake rather than synthesis.\n\nWe had previously reported that the PVW neuron stains with anti-serotonin antibodies exclusively in males but we did not detect expression of a fosmid-based reporter for the serotonin-synthesizing enzyme TPH-1 (*Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b*). We confirmed the lack of *tph-1* expression with our new *tph-1* reporter allele in both males and hermaphrodites, and also found that hermaphrodite and male PVW does not express the reporter allele for the other enzyme in the serotonin synthesis pathway, *bas-1*. Because of very dim *cat-1::mCherry* fosmid-based reporter expression that was only detected upon anti-mCherry antibody staining, we had assigned PVW as a serotonin-releasing neuron (*Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b*). However, we failed to detect expression of our new *cat-1/VMAT* reporter allele in PVW. Neither did we detect expression of the *mod-5(vlc47)* reporter allele. Taken together, PVW either synthesizes or uptakes serotonin by unconventional means, akin to the pharyngeal I5 neuron.\n\nIn conclusion, although there are some updates in the levels of dimorphic gene expression (PVN and ADF neuron classes), our analysis with reporter alleles does not reveal pervasive novel sexual dimorphism in sex-shared neurons compared to those that we previously identified in *Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b*. These sexual dimorphisms are summarized in **Supplementary file 4**."

                        "contents": "In vertebrates, glia can produce various signaling molecules, including neurotransmitters (*Araque et al., 2014; Savtchouk and Volterra, 2018*). There is some limited evidence for neurotransmitter synthesis in *C. elegans* glia. In males, it had been reported that the socket glia of spicule neurons synthesize and utilize dopamine, based on their expression of *cat-2/TH* and *bas-1/AAAD* (*Lints and Emmons, 1999; Hare and Loer, 2004; LeBoeuf et al., 2014*). We confirmed this notion with *cat-2/TH* and *bas-1/AAAD* reporter alleles (Figure 14A). Additionally, we detected expression of the *cat-1/VMAT* reporter allele in these cells (Figure 14A), indicating that these glia secrete dopamine by canonical vesicular transport. We did not detect *cat-1/VMAT* in other glial cell types. In addition to the spicule socket glia, we also observed *bas-1(syb5923)* reporter allele expression in cells that are likely to be the spicule sheath glia (Figure 14A), as well as in additional glial cell types in the head and tail (Figure 14B). We detected no glial expression of other monoaminergic synthesis machinery.\n\nWe detected no expression of vesicular transporters or biosynthetic synthesis machinery for non-aminergic transmitters in glia of either sex. This observation contrasts previous reports on GABA synthesis and release from the AMsh glial cell type (*Duan et al., 2020; Fernandez-Abascal et al., 2022*). We were not able to detect signals in AMsh with anti-GABA staining, nor with an SL2- or T2A-based GFP-based reporter allele for any *unc-25* isoform (*Gendrel et al., 2016*) (M Gendrel, pers. comm.; this paper).\n\nThere is, however, abundant evidence for neurotransmitter uptake by *C. elegans* glial cells, mirroring this specific function of vertebrate glia (*Henn and Hamberger, 1971*). We had previously shown that one specific glia-like cell type in *C. elegans*, the GLR glia, take up GABA via the GABA uptake transporter SNF-11 (*Gendrel et al., 2016*). We did not detect *unc-47/VGAT* fosmid-based reporter expression in the GLRs (*Gendrel et al., 2016*) and also detected no expression with our *unc-47/VGAT* reporter allele. Hence, these glia are unlikely to release GABA via classic vesicular machinery. Other release mechanisms for GABA can of course not be excluded. Aside from the *snf-11* expression in GLR glia (*Gendrel et al., 2016*), we detected expression of the putative tyramine uptake transporter *oct-1/OCT* in a number of head glial cells (Figure 8K), as well as broad glial expression of the betaine uptake transporter *snf-3/BGT1* in the head, midbody, and tail (Figure 9E and F). These results indicate tyramine and betaine clearance roles for glia."

This suggests alternative release mechanisms for tyramine and octopamine. A  \nvertebrate homolog of the putative tyramine uptake transporter, oct-1, has been found to be located  \npresynaptically and to co-purify with synaptosomes (Berry et al., 2016; Matsui et al., 2016), there-  \nfore indicating that this transporter may have the potential to also act in tyramine release, at least in  \nvertebrate cells.

Instead, these neurons acquire GABA and sero-  \ntonin through uptaking them via defined uptake transporters, SNF-11/BGT1 for GABA (Mullen et al.,  \n2006) and MOD-5/SERT for serotonin (Ranganathan et al., 2001; Jafari et al., 2011). A combination  \nof CeNGEN scRNA transcriptome and our reporter allele data corroborates the absence of synthesis  \nmachinery in these presumptive uptake neurons (*Tables 1 and 2*). One interesting question that  \nrelates to these uptake neurons is whether they serve as \u2018sinks\u2019 for clearance of a neurotransmitter or  \nwhether the taken-up neurotransmitter is subsequently \u2018recycled\u2019 for synaptic release via a vesicular  \ntransporter. Previous data, as well as our updated expression profiles, provide evidence for both  \nscenarios: ALA and AVF do not synthesize GABA via UNC-25/GAD, but they stain with anti-GABA  \nantibodies in a manner that is dependent on the uptake transporter SNF-11 (Gendrel et al., 2016).  \nALA expresses *unc-47*, hence it is likely to synaptically release GABA, but AVF does not, and it is  \ntherefore apparently involved only in GABA clearance. Similarly, RIH, AIM, and PGA express the  \nserotonin uptake transporter *mod-5/SERT* and stain for serotonin in a MOD-5-dependent manner."

This suggests that GABA  \nmay be acquired by these neurons through non-canonical uptake or synthesis mechanisms. Also, the  \nAVA and AVB neurons do not express UNC-47 (*Gendrel et al., 2016; Taylor et al., 2021*) (this study);  \nhence, it is not clear if or how GABA is released from them. A member of the bestrophin family of  \nion channels has been shown to mediate GABA release from astrocyte glia in vertebrates (*Lee et al.,*  \n*2010*) and, more recently, from *C. elegans* glia (*Cheng et al., 2024; Graziano et al., 2024*). However,  \nwhile there are more than 20 bestrophin channels encoded in the *C. elegans* genome (*Hobert, 2013*),  \nthey do not appear to be expressed in the AVA or AVB neurons, based on CeNGEN scRNA data  \n(*Taylor et al., 2021*).  \nThe co-expression of a specific uptake transporter and a vesicular transporter corroborates the  \npotential usage of betaine as a neurotransmitter. Betaine is known to be synthesized in *C. elegans*  \nbut is also taken up via its diet (*Peden et al., 2013; Hardege et al., 2022*). Betaine has documented  \neffects on *C. elegans* behavior and acts via activation of several betaine-gated ion channels (*Peden*  \n*et al., 2013; Hardege et al., 2022*). Expression of biosynthetic enzymes suggests betaine production  \nin at least the RIM neuron class, which also expresses the vesicular transporter *cat-1/VMAT*, capable of  \ntransporting betaine (*Hardege et al., 2022*). The expression of the betaine uptake transporter *snf-3/*  \n*BGT1* in CAN, AUA, RIR, ASI, and male-specific neuron PDC, coupled with their co-expression of  \n*cat-1/VMAT*, suggests that several distinct neuron classes in different parts of the nervous system may  \nuptake betaine and engage in vesicular betaine release via CAT-1/VMAT to gate betaine-activated ion  \nchannels, such as ACR-23 (*Peden et al., 2013*) or LGC-41 (*Hardege et al., 2022*). Additionally, we  \ndetected the *snf-3/BGT1* reporter allele in several other neuron classes that do not co-express *cat-1/*  \n*VMAT*. This indicates that these neurons could function as betaine clearance neurons.  \nLastly, based on sequence similarity and expression pattern, we predict that the ortholog of the  \nOCT subclass of SLC22 family, *oct-1*, could serve as a tyramine uptake transporter in *C. elegans*. We  \nidentified RIM as the only neuron expressing an *oct-1* reporter allele, suggesting that like several other  \nmonoaminergic neuron classes, RIM both synthesizes its monoaminergic transmitter and reuptakes it  \nafter release."

Yet, in some neurons (e.g. the SIA neurons) expression of  \n*unc-47* is easily detectable and robust (based on fosmid-based reporter, reporter allele, and scRNA  \ndata), indicating that VGAT may transport another presently unknown neurotransmitter (*Gendrel*  \n*et al., 2016*). In vertebrates, VGAT transports both GABA and glycine, and the same is observed for  \nUNC-47 *in vitro* (*Aubrey et al., 2007*). While the *C. elegans* genome encodes no easily recognizable  \northolog of known ionotropic glycine receptors, it does encode anion channels that are closely related  \nby primary sequence (*Hobert, 2013*). Moreover, a recently identified metabotropic glycine receptor,  \nGPR158 (*Laboute et al., 2023*), has a clear sequence ortholog in *C. elegans*, F39B2.8.

There are also several *cat-1/VMAT*-positive male-specific neurons that express only a subset of the biosynthetic machinery involved in the biosynthesis of known aminergic transmitters in the worm. That is, some neurons express *cat-1/VMAT* and *bas-1/AAAD*, but none of the previously known enzymes that produce the substrate for BAS-1, i.e., CAT-2 or TPH-1 (Figure 1A). In these neurons, BAS-1/AAAD may decarboxylate an unmodified (i.e. non-hydroxylated) aromatic amino acid as substrate to produce, for example, the trace amine PEA from phenylalanine (**Table 2, Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A**). A subset of these neurons (all being B-type ray sensory neurons) co-express *tbh-1*, which may use PEA as a substrate to produce the trace amine, PEOH. PEOH is a purported neurotransmitter in Aplysia (*Saavedra et al., 1977*) and the vertebrate brain (*Saavedra and Axelrod, 1973*) and can indeed be detected in *C. elegans* extracts (F Schroeder, pers. comm.).\n\n*bas-1/AAAD* may also be responsible for the synthesis of histamine, an aminergic neurotransmitter that can be found in extracts of *C. elegans* (**Pertel and Wilson, 1974**). The only other AAAD that displays reasonable sequence similarity to neurotransmitter-producing AAADs is the *hdl-1* gene (*Hare and Loer, 2004; Hobert, 2013; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1B*), for which we, however, did not detect any expression in the *C. elegans* nervous system (Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1C and D). Since there are neurons that only express *bas-1/AAAD*, but no enzyme that produces canonical substrates for *bas-1/AAAD* (*tph-1/TPH, cat-2/TH; Figure 1A*), and since at least a subset of these neurons express the monoamine transporter *cat-1/VMAT* (**Table 2**), *bas-1/AAAD* may be involved in synthesizing another currently unknown bioactive monoamine.\n\nConversely, based on the expression of *tph-1*, but concurrent absence of *bas-1/AAAD*, the pharyngeal MI neuron, hermaphrodite VC4 and VC5, and male neurons CEM and R9B may produce 5-HTP (**Table 2**). 5-HTP may either be used directly as a signaling molecule or it may be metabolized into some other serotonin derivative, an interesting possibility in light of serotonin derivatives produced elsewhere in the body (*Yu et al., 2023*).\n\nAdditionally, three neuron classes (IL2, HOB, and R5B) express *tbh-1* but lack expression of any other genes in canonical monoaminergic pathways, including *bas-1* (**Table 2**). Taken together, canonical monoaminergic pathway genes are expressed in unconventional combinations in several neuron classes, pointing toward the existence of yet undiscovered amino acid-derived neuronal signaling systems."

Six sex-shared neurons (AVH, BDU, PVM, PVQ, PVW, RMG) and one male-specific neuron (SPD) fall into this category. Most of these neurons exhibit features that are consistent with them being entirely neuropeptidergic. First, electron microscopy has revealed a relative paucity of clear synaptic vesicles in most of these neurons (*White et al., 1986; Cook et al., 2019; Witvliet et al., 2021*). Second, not only do these neurons express a multitude of neuropeptide-encoding genes (*Taylor et al., 2021*), but they also display a dense interconnectivity in the \u2018wireless\u2019 neuropeptidergic connectome (*Ripoll-S\u00e1nchez et al., 2023*).\n\nThat said, electron microscopy shows that some of the neurons devoid of conventional neurotransmitter pathway genes generate synapses with small, clear synaptic vesicles, indicative of the use of non-peptidergic transmitters (e.g. the sex-shared RMG and PVM neurons or the male-specific SPD neurons) (*White et al., 1986; Cook et al., 2019; Witvliet et al., 2021*).

Neurotransmitter co-transmission has been observed in multiple combinations in the vertebrate brain (*Wallace and Sabatini, 2023*). In *C. elegans*, the most frequent co-transmission configurations are a classic, fast transmitter (acetylcholine or glutamate) with a monoamine. Co-transmission of two distinct monoaminergic systems also exists. In several cases, however, it is not clear whether the second neurotransmitter is indeed used for communication or whether its presence is merely a reflection of this neuron being solely a clearance neuron. For example, the glutamatergic AIM neuron stains positive for serotonin, which it uptakes via the uptake transporter MOD-5, but it does not express the vesicular monoamine transporter cat-1/VMAT (**Figures 3, 6, and 8, Tables 1 and 2**).\n\nCo-transmission of small, fast-acting neurotransmitters (glutamate, GABA, acetylcholine) does exist, but it is rare (**Figure 3**). The most prominent co-transmission configuration is acetylcholine with glutamate, but acetylcholine can also be co-transmitted with GABA. There are no examples of co-transmission of glutamate and GABA, as observed in several regions of the vertebrate brain (*Wallace and Sabatini, 2023*). There are also examples of possible co-transmission of three transmitters (**Figure 3**).\n\nInterestingly, co-transmission appears to be much more prevalent in the male-specific nervous system, compared to the sex-shared nervous system (**Figure 3, Supplementary file 3**). This may relate to male-specific neurons displaying a greater degree of anatomical complexity compared to the hermaphrodite nervous system, both in terms of branching patterns and extent of synaptic connectivity (*Jarrell et al., 2012; Cook et al., 2019*). Given that all co-transmitting neurons display multiple synaptic outputs (*Cook et al., 2019*), it appears possible that each individual neurotransmitter secretory system is distributed to distinct synapses. Based on vertebrate precedent (*Wallace and Sabatini, 2023*), co-release from the same vesicles is also possible."

Using *C. elegans* as a model, we have been able to precisely investigate (a) whether sex-specific neurons display a bias in neurotransmitter usage and (b) whether there are neurotransmitter dimorphisms in sex-shared neurons (*Pereira et al., 2015; Gendrel et al., 2016; Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b*) (this paper).

Evidence of neurotransmitter synthesis and release also exists in *C. elegans* glia. Previous work indicated that glia associated with male-specific spicule neurons synthesize (through *cat-2/TH* and *bas-1/AAAD*) the monoaminergic transmitter dopamine to control sperm ejaculation (*LeBoeuf et al., 2014*). Our identification of *cat-1/VMAT* expression in these glia indicate that dopamine is released via the canonical vesicular monoamine transporter. We also detected expression of *bas-1/AAAD* in additional male and hermaphrodite glia, indicating the production of other signaling substances released by these glia. *bas-1* has indeed recently been shown to be involved in the synthesis of a class of unconventional serotonin derivatives (*Yu et al., 2023*).\n\nThere have been previous reports on GABA synthesis and release from the AMsh glial cell type (*Duan et al., 2020; Fernandez-Abascal et al., 2022*). We were not able to detect AMsh with anti-GABA staining, nor with reporter alleles of *unc-25/GAD*. However, since very low levels of *unc-25* are observed in the AMsh scRNA datasets (*Taylor et al., 2021; Purice et al., 2023*), the abundance of GABA in AMsh may lie below conventional detection levels.\n\nOutside the nervous system, the most prominent and functionally best characterized usage of neurotransmitters lies in the hermaphrodite somatic gonad, which has been shown to synthesize octopamine and use it to control oocyte quiescence (*Alkema et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2021*). Intriguingly, we also detected *tbh-1*, *tdc-1*, and *cat-1* expression in the somatic gonad of the male, specifically the vas deferens, which is known to contain secretory granules that are positive for secretory molecular markers (*Nonet et al., 1993*). The presence of octopamine is unexpected because, unlike oocytes, sperm are not presently known to require monoaminergic signals for any aspect of their maturation. It will be interesting to assess sperm differentiation and function of *tbh-1* or *tdc-1* mutant animals. The usage of monoaminergic signaling systems in the gonad is not restricted to *C. elegans* and has been discussed in the context of sperm functionality and oocyte maturation in vertebrates (*Mayerhofer et al., 1999; Ram\u00edrez-Reveco et al., 2017; Alhajeri et al., 2022*)."

The bottom-line conclusions of these comparisons are:\n\n1. Reporter alleles reveal more sites of expression than fosmid-based reporters. It is unclear whether this is due to the lack of *cis*-regulatory elements in fosmid-based reporters or issues associated with the multicopy nature of these reporters (e.g. RNAi-based gene silencing of multicopy arrays or squelching of regulatory factors). Another factor to consider is that neuron identification for most fosmid-based reporters was carried out prior to the introduction of NeuroPAL. Consequently, errors occasionally occurred, as exemplified by the misidentification of neuron IDs for CA7 and CP7 in previous instances (*Serrano-Saiz et al., 2017b*).\n\n2. The best possible reporter approaches (i.e. reporter alleles) show very good overlap with scRNA data, thereby validating each approach. However, our comparisons also show that no single approach is perfect. CeNGEN scRNA data can miss transcripts and can also show transcripts in cells in which there is no independent evidence for gene or protein expression. Conversely, antibody staining displays vagaries related to staining protocols and protein localization, which can be overcome with reporter approaches, but the price to pay with reporter alleles is that if they are based on SL2 or T2A strategies, they may fail to detect additional levels of posttranslational regulation, which may result in protein absence even in the presence of transcripts. The existence of such mechanisms may be a possible explanation for cases where the expression of synthesis and/or transport machinery expression does not match up (e.g. *tdc-1*(-); *tbh-1*(+) neurons).\n\nOur detailed analysis of reporter allele expression has uncovered several cases where expression of a neurotransmitter pathway gene in a given neuron class appears very low and variable from animal to animal. Such variability only exists when expression is dim, thus one possible explanation for it is that expression levels merely hover around an arbitrary microscopical detection limit. However, we cannot rule out the other possibility that this may also reflect true on/off variability of gene expression. Taking this notion a step further, we cannot exclude the possibility that expression observed with reporter alleles misses sites of expression. This possibility is raised by our inability to detect *unc-25/GAD* reporter allele expression in AMsh glia (*Duan et al., 2020; Fernandez-Abascal et al., 2022*) or *eat-4* reporter allele expression in AVL and DVB neurons, in which some (but not other) multicopy"

Efforts to map neurotransmitter usage on a system-wide level are underway in other organisms, most notably, *Drosophila melanogaster* (**Deng et al., 2019; Eckstein et al., 2024**). The *C. elegans* neurotransmitter map presented here comprises a critical step toward deciphering information flow in the nervous system and provides valuable tools for studying the genetic mechanisms underlying cell identity specification. Moreover, this neurotransmitter map opens new opportunities for investigating sex-specific neuronal differentiation processes, particularly in the male-specific nervous system, where a scarcity of molecular markers has limited the analysis of neuronal identity control. Lastly, our analysis strongly suggests that additional neurotransmitter systems remain to be identified.\n\nWhile the gene expression patterns delineated here enable informed predictions about novel neuronal functions and neurotransmitter identities, further investigations involving genetic perturbations, high-resolution imaging, complementary functional assays, and analyses across developmental stages are needed to shed further light on neurotransmitter usage. Nonetheless, this comprehensive neurotransmitter map provides a robust foundation for deciphering neural information flow, elucidating developmental mechanisms governing neuronal specification, exploring sexual dimorphisms in neuronal differentiation, and potentially uncovering novel neurotransmitter systems awaiting characterization."
