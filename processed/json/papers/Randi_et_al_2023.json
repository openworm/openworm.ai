Here, to better understand the relationship between the structure and the function of a nervous system, we systematically measure signal propagation in 23,433 pairs of neurons across the head of the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans* by direct optogenetic activation and simultaneous whole-brain calcium imaging. We measure the sign (excitatory or inhibitory), strength, temporal properties and causal direction of signal propagation between these neurons to create a functional atlas. We find that signal propagation differs from model predictions that are based on anatomy. Using mutants, we show that extrasynaptic signalling not visible from anatomy contributes to this difference. We identify many instances of dense-core-vesicle-dependent signalling, including on timescales of less than a second, that evoke acute calcium transients\u2014often where no direct wired connection exists but where relevant neuropeptides and receptors are expressed. We propose that, in such cases, extrasynaptically released neuropeptides serve a similar function to that of classical neurotransmitters. Finally, our measured signal propagation atlas better predicts the neural dynamics of spontaneous activity than do models based on anatomy. We conclude that both synaptic and extrasynaptic signalling drive neural dynamics on short timescales, and that measurements of evoked signal propagation are crucial for interpreting neural function."

This approach to revealing neural function drives large-scale efforts to generate connectomes\u2014anatomical maps of the synaptic contacts of the brain\u2014in a diverse set of organisms, ranging from mice3 to *Platynereis4. The C. elegans* connectome1,5,6 is the most mature of these efforts, and has been used to reveal circuit-level mechanisms of sensorimotor processing7,8, to constrain models of neural dynamics9 and to make predictions of neural function10. Anatomy, however, omits key aspects of neurons\u2019 inputs and outputs, or leaves them ambiguous: the strength and sign (excitatory or inhibitory) of a neural connection are not always evident from wiring or gene expression. Historically, this and related perturbative approaches have been called many names (Supplementary Information), but they all stand in contrast to correlative approaches that seek to infer neural function from activity correlations alone. Correlative approaches do not directly measure causality and are limited to finding relations among only those neurons that happen to be active. Perturbative approaches measure signal propagation directly, but previous efforts have been restricted to selected circuits or subregions of the brain, and have often achieved only cell-type and not single-cell resolution17\u201322."

Validation of the GUR-3/PRDX-2 system is discussed in the Supplementary Information (see also Extended Data Fig. 2h and Supplementary Video 1).

A stimulus duration of 0.3\u2009s or 0.5\u2009s was chosen to evoke modest calcium responses (Extended Data Fig. 2f), similar in amplitude to those evoked naturally by odour stimuli\u00b2\u2078."

The kernel gives the activity of the downstream neuron when convolved with the activity of the upstream neuron. The kernel describes how the signal is transformed from upstream to downstream neuron for that stimulus event, including the timescales of the signal transfer (Extended Data Fig. 6b,c). We characterized the variability of each functional connection by comparing how these kernels transform a standard stimulus (Extended Data Fig. 6e). Kernels for many neuron pairs varied across trials and animals, presumably because of state- and history-dependent effects\u2074\u2075, including from neuromodulation16,46, plasticity and interanimal variability in wiring and expression. As expected, kernels from one neuron pair were more similar to each other than to kernels from other pairs (Extended Data Fig. 6f)."

RID had dim tagRFP-T expression, so we adjusted our analysis protocol for only this neuron, as described in the Methods. Many neurons responded to RID activation (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07c), including URX, ADL and AWB, three neuron subtypes that were predicted from anatomy to have no response (Fig. 4a). These three neurons showed strong responses in WT animals but their responses were reduced or absent in unc-31 mutants (Fig. 4b\u2013d), consistent with dense-core-vesicle-mediated extrasynaptic signalling. The gene expression and wiring of these neurons also suggest that peptidergic extrasynaptic signalling is producing the observed responses. All three express receptors for peptides produced by RID (NPR-4 and NPR-11 for FLP-14 and PDFR-1 for PDF-1), and no direct (monosynaptic) wiring connects RID to URX, ADL or AWB: a minimum of two hops are required from RID to URXL or AWBR, and three from RID to ADLR. These shortest paths all rely on fragile single-contact synapses that appear in only one out of the four individual connectomes. We conclude that RID signals to other neurons extrasynaptically, and that this is captured by signal propagation measurements but not by anatomy."

There are no direct chemical or electrical synapses between M3L and URYVL, but stimulation of M3L evokes unc-31-dependent calcium activity in URYVL (Fig. 5b). The majority of neuron pairs identified in our screen express peptide and receptor combinations consistent with extrasynaptic signalling (Supplementary Table 1). For example, M3L expresses FLP-4, which binds to the receptor NPR-4, expressed by URVYL; and FLP-5, which binds to the receptor NPR-11, also expressed by URYVL. The bilateral neuron pair AVDR and AVDL was also identified in our screen for having purely extrasynaptic-dependent connections."

The bilateral extrasynaptic signalling that we observe is consistent with this prediction because two neurons that express the same autocrine signalling machinery can necessarily signal to one another. AVD was also predicted to be among the top 25 highest-degree \u2018hub\u2019 nodes in a peptidergic network based on gene expression, and, in agreement, AVD is highly represented among hits in our screen."

Spontaneous activity was measured in immobilized worms lacking optogenetic actuators under bright imaging conditions. A matrix of bare anatomical weights (synapse counts) was a poor predictor of the correlations of spontaneous activity (left bar, Fig. 6), consistent with previous reports27,41. The connectome-constrained biophysical model from Fig. 3 better predicted spontaneous activity correlations (middle bars, Fig. 6; described in the Methods)\u2014as we would expect because it considers all anatomical paths through the network\u2014but it still performed fairly poorly. Predictions based on our functional measurements of signal propagation kernels (right bars, Fig. 6) performed best of all at predicting spontaneous activity correlations. To generate predictions of correlations either from the biophysical model or from our functional kernel measurements required the activity of a set of neurons to be driven in silico. For the biophysical model, driving all neurons was optimal, but for the kernel-based predictions, driving a specific set of six neurons (\u2018top-n\u2019) markedly improved performance. We conclude that functionally derived predictions based on our measured signal propagation kernels better agree with spontaneous activity than do either a bare description of anatomical weights or an established model constrained by the connectome, and that some subsets of neurons make outsized contributions to driving spontaneous dynamics. The kernel-based simulation (interactive version at https://funsim.princeton.edu) outperforms other models of neural dynamics presumably for two reasons: first, it extracts all relevant parameters directly from."

This software was greatly optimized to identify neurons in real time, to also enable closed-loop targeting and stimulus delivery (as described in \u2018Stimulus delivery and pulsed laser\u2019). Two design choices made this algorithm considerably faster than previous approaches. First, a local maxima search was used instead of a slower watershed-type segmentation. Neurons in the ventral ganglion are hard to identify because it appears as very crowded when viewed in the most common orientation that worms assume when mounted on a microscope slide. The nuclei of C. elegans neurons are approximately spheres and so they can be identified and separated by a simple local maxima search. Second, we factorized the three-dimensional (3D) local maxima search into multiple two-dimensional (2D) local maxima searches. In fact, any local maximum in a 3D image is also a local maximum in the 2D image in which it is located. Local maxima were therefore first found in each 2D image separately, and then candidate local maxima were discarded or retained by comparing them to their immediate surroundings in the other planes. This makes the algorithm less computationally intensive and fast enough to also be used in real time. We refer to this type of algorithm as \u2018pseudo\u2019-segmentation because it finds the centre of neurons without fully describing the extent and boundaries of each neuron."

The imaging focal plane was scanned through the brain of the worm remotely using an electrically tunable lens (Optotune EL-16-40-TC) instead of moving the objective. The use of remote focusing allowed us to decouple the z-position of the imaging focal plane and that of the optogenetics two-photon spot (described below). Images were acquired by an sCMOS camera, and each acquired image frame was associated to the focal length of the tunable lens (z-position in the sample) at which it was acquired. To ensure the correct association between frames and z-position, we recorded the analogue signal describing the focal length of the tunable lens at time points synchronous with a trigger pulse output by the camera. By counting the camera triggers from the start of the recording, the z-positions could be associated to the correct frame, bypassing unknown operating-system-mediated latencies between the image stream from the camera and the acquisition of analogue signals."

Extended Data Fig. 2c,d shows how our two-photon excitation spot selectively targets individual neurons, because it photobleaches tagRFP-T only in the neuron that we decide to target, and not in nearby neurons. To faithfully characterize the spot size, we set the laser power such that the two-photon interaction probability profile of the excitation spot would not saturate the two-photon absorption probability of tagRFP-T. Second, we showed that our excitation spot is restricted along the z-axis by targeting a neuron and observing its calcium activity. When the excitation was directed at the neuron but shifted by 4\u2009\u03bcm along z, the neuron showed no activation. By contrast, the neuron showed activation when the spot was correctly positioned on the neuron (Extended Data Fig. 2e).

A different policy applies to dim neurons of interest that are not automatically detected by the pseudo-segmentation algorithm in the 3D image used as reference for the point-set registration algorithm. In those cases, we manually added the position of those neurons to the reference 3D image. If these \u2018added\u2019 neurons are automatically detected in most of the other 3D images, then a calcium activity trace can be successfully produced by the DSMM nonrigid registration algorithm, and is treated as any other trace. However, if the \u2018added\u2019 neurons are too dim to be detected also in the other 3D images and the calcium activity trace cannot be formed for more than 50% of the total time points, the activity trace for those neurons is extracted from the neuron\u2019s position as determined from the position of neighbouring neurons. In the analysis code, we refer to these as \u2018matchless\u2019 traces, because the reference neuron is not matched to any detected neuron in the specific 3D image, but its position is just transformed according to the DSMM nonrigid deformation field. In this way, we are able to recover the calcium activity of some neurons whose tagRFP-T expression is otherwise too dim to be reliably detected by the pseudo-segmentation algorithm. Responses to RID stimulation shown in Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 7c are an exception to this policy. In these cases, the activity of any neuron for which there is not a trace for more than 50% of the time points is substituted with the corresponding \u2018matchless\u2019 trace, and not just for the manually added neurons. This is important to be able to show responses of neurons such as ADL, which have dim tagRFP-T expression. In the RID-specific case, to exclude responses that become very large solely because of numerical issues in the division by the baseline activity owing to the dim tagRFP-T, we also introduce a threshold excluding \u0394F/F\u2009>\u20092."

The general strategy for calculating stereotypy was to convolve different kernels with the same stimulus inputs and compare the resulting outputs. The similarity of two outputs is reported as a Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient. Kernels corresponding to different stimulus-response events of the same pair of neurons were compared with one another round-robin style, one round-robin each for a given input stimulus. For inputs we chose the set of all stimuli delivered to the upstream neuron.

The rise time was zero if the peak of the kernel was at time t\u2009=\u20090. However, saturation of the signal transmission can make kernels appear slower than the connection actually is. For example, the simplest instantaneous connection would be represented by a single decaying exponential in equation (1), which would have its peak at time t\u2009=\u20090. However, if that connection is saturating, a second, opposite-sign term in the sum is needed to fit the kernel. This second term would make the kernel have a later peak, thereby masking the instantaneous nature of the connection. To account for this effect of saturation, we removed terms representing saturation from the kernels and found the rise time of these \u2018non-saturating\u2019 kernels."

We list these connections and provide additional examples in Extended Data Fig. 9. Using a recent neuropeptide\u2013GPCR interaction screen in C. elegans52 and gene-expression data from CeNGEN38, we find putative combinations of neuropeptides and GPCRs that can mediate those connections (Supplementary Table 1). We produced such a list of neuropeptide and GPCR combinations using the Python package Worm Neuro Atlas (https://github.com/francescorandi/wormneuroatlas). In the list, we only include transcripts from CeNGEN detected with the highest confidence (threshold 4), as described previously51. For each neuron pair, we first searched the CeNGEN database for neuropeptides expressed in the upstream neuron, then identified potential GPCR targets for each neuropeptide using information from previous reports52,74, and finally went back to the CeNGEN database to find whether the downstream neuron in the pair was among the neurons expressing the specific GPCRs. The existence of potential combinations of neuropeptide and GPCR putatively mediating signalling supports our observation that communication in the candidate neuron pairs that we identify can indeed be mediated extrasynaptically through neuropeptidergic machinery."

Sample size was chosen to be many fold larger than typical C. elegans calcium imaging experiments in the field, e.g. Hallinen et al., elife 2021.\n- Data exclusions: Inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in the \"Inclusion criteria\" subsection of the Methods, and pasted here: Stimulation events were included for further analysis if they evoked a detectable calcium response in the stimulated neuron (autoresponse). A classifier determined whether the response was detected by inspecting whether the amplitude of both the DF/F transient and its second derivative exceeded a pair of thresholds. The same threshold values were applied to every animal, strain, neuron and stimulation event, and were originally set to match human perception of a response above noise. Stimulation events that did not meet both thresholds for a contiguous 4 seconds were excluded. RID responses shown in Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 7c are an exception to this policy. RID is visible based on its CyOFP expression, but its tagRFP-T expression is too dim to consistently extract calcium signals. Therefore in Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 7c (but not in other figures, like Fig. 2) responses to RID stimulation were included even in cases where it was not possible to extract a calcium-activity trace in RID.\n- Neuron traces were excluded from analysis if a human was unable to assign an identity or if the imaging time points were absent in a contiguous segment longer than 5% of the response window due to imaging artifacts or tracking errors. A different policy applies to dim neurons of interest that are not automatically detected by the \"pseudo\"-segmentation algorithm in the 3D image used as reference for the pointset registration algorithm. In those cases, we manually added the position of those neurons to the reference 3D image. If these \"added\" neurons are automatically detected in most of the other 3D images, then a calcium activity trace can be successfully produced by the DSMM nonrigid registration algorithm and is treated as any other trace. However, if the \"added\" neurons are too dim to be detected also in the other 3D images and the calcium activity trace cannot be formed for more than 50% of the total time points, the activity trace for those neurons is extracted from the neuron's position as determined from the position of neighboring neurons. In the analysis code, we refer to these as \"matchless\" traces, because the reference neuron is not matched to any detected neuron in the specific 3D image, but its position is just transformed according to the DSMM nonrigid deformation field. In this way, we are able to recover the calcium activity also of some neurons whose tag-RFP-T expression is otherwise too dim to be reliably detected by the \"pseudo\"-segmentation algorithm. Responses to RID stimulation shown in Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 7c are an exception to this policy. There, the activity of any neuron for which there is not a trace for more than 50% of the time points is substituted with the corresponding \"matchless\" trace, and not just for the manually added neurons. This is important to be able to show responses of neurons like ADL, which have dim tagRFP-T expression. In the RID-specific case, in"
