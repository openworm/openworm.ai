Recent experiments have demonstrated that the worm displays the full range of intermediate behaviors when placed in intermediate environments. The continuous nature of this transition strongly suggests that these behaviors all stem from modulation of a single underlying mechanism. We present a model of *C. elegans* forward locomotion that includes a neuromuscular control system that relies on a sensory feedback mechanism to generate undulations and is integrated with a physical model of the body and environment. We find that the model reproduces the entire swim-crawl transition, as well as locomotion in complex and heterogeneous environments. This is achieved with no modulatory mechanism, except via the proprioceptive response to the physical environment. Manipulations of the model are used to dissect the proposed pattern generation mechanism and its modulation. The model suggests a possible role for GABAergic D-class neurons in forward locomotion and makes a number of experimental predictions, in particular with respect to non-linearities in the model and to symmetry breaking between the neuromuscular systems on the ventral and dorsal sides of the body."

Adapting to different environments often involves the use of qualitatively distinct patterns of locomotion, called gaits. The animal's nervous system is responsible for generating the rhythmic neuromuscular activity associated with each of these gaits and must coordinate the task of switching seamlessly between them. Furthermore, the animal must be able to reliably adapt any of these patterns in response to external perturbations. Understanding the neural basis of animal locomotion is an important challenge that has received considerable attention (Kiehn et al., 1998; Grillner and Wall\u00e9n, 2002; Hill et al., 2003; Borgmann et al., 2009)."

Moreover, the behavioral roles of many of these neurons have been uncovered using experimental techniques including targeted cell killing (Chalfie et al., 1985; McIntire et al., 1993b) and genetic mutations (Brenner, 1974; McIntire et al., 1993a). The result is an organism in which the nervous system is mapped at cellular resolution. Despite its small size and the apparent simplicity of the underlying nervous system, the worm is capable of a surprisingly rich repertoire of behaviors including navigation and foraging, mating, learning, and even rudimentary social behavior (aggregation)."

Specifically, the body undulations used by the worm when swimming in liquid or crawling on a firm gel substrate like agar are kinematically different (see Movie S1 in Supplementary Material), and have generally been thought to represent two distinct gaits (White et al., 1986; Pierce-Shimomura et al., 2008). In line with this two gait hypothesis, previous models of the worm's locomotion (Niebur and Erd\u00f6s, 1991; Bryden and Cohen, 2004, 2008; Karbowski et al., 2008) have mostly addressed crawling on agar. Recent results, however, demonstrated that forward swimming and crawling are two extremes in a spectrum of behaviors. Indeed the intermediate waveforms can be revealed by placing worms in appropriate intermediate media (Berri et al., 2009; Fang-Yen et al., 2010; Sznitman et al., 2010; Boyle et al., 2011). The continuity of the swim-crawl transition strongly suggests that the entire range of behaviors are produced through modulation of a single neural mechanism. This discovery sets an exciting new challenge to develop a model of the worm that is capable of reproducing the entire range of locomotor behaviors."

Specifically, proprioceptive mechanisms are thought to channel information to the motoneurons about the bending of the body (posteriorly and possibly locally). In differing physical environments, the response to identical muscle activation patterns would produce different body shapes, thus constituting completely passive environment-mediated modulation of the locomotion. Under such conditions, one would also expect the proprioceptive signal to differ, providing closed-loop neural control and adaptation of the neuromuscular pattern of activity to variable environments. Indeed, in our model, such sensory feedback is the primary driving force behind the oscillation mechanism."

The model body is divided into repeating \"segments\" and articulated by pairs of (D)orsal and (V)entral muscles, with each muscle located in the gap between two points of the physical model (see Figures 1A,B). The hydrostatic skeleton and muscles are represented by a combination of damped springs and solid rods connecting these points. Each resulting set of four points and two muscles is referred to as a segment. The number of segments thus corresponds to the number of muscle pairs in the model. We have chosen M = 48 to provide a good approximation of a smooth (biologically unsegmented) body without being excessively computationally expensive. This number also approximates closely the number of muscles along the body (C. elegans has 48 dorsal and 47 ventral muscle cells).

The ventral cord subcircuit associated with forward locomotion contains four main classes of motoneurons (11 VB, 7 DB, 13 VD, and 6 DD neurons) and one key pair of interneurons (class AVB). Longitudinal body wall muscles line the body. These muscles contract and relax in the dorso-ventral plane. The individual members of each motoneuron class are arranged sequentially along the body such that their motor output regions do not overlap (White et al., 1986). In line with previous models (Niebur and Erd\u00f6s, 1991; Bryden and Cohen, 2004, 2008; Karbowski et al., 2008), we consider a simplified, symmetrized neural circuit, disregarding the asymmetry in neuron numbers, and thus allowing us to create the model as a series of repeating units. In a rough correspondence with muscle and neuron numbers (on the ventral side), we chose to model N = 12 neural units, with each controlling M/N = 4 muscle segments. These neural units are identical, except for changes in certain parameters. These simplifications are designed to aid the analysis of the circuit and its dynamics and to reduce the number of free parameters. While this approximation is reasonable for a model that is restricted to generating sinuous undulations, it may need revisiting for models to capture a richer set of behaviors, in particular where additional classes of neurons are included."

DD (VD) neurons receive input from VB (DB) motoneurons and inhibit the opposing dorsal (ventral) muscles. Thus excitation of muscles on one side of the body is likely to result in inhibition of muscles on the opposite side. Chen et al. (2006) have also reported some inhibitory connections from VD to VB neurons which provide motoneuron-to-motoneuron inhibition on the ventral side. These connections do not feature in the connectivity diagrams of White et al. (1986) and are seldom discussed. In addition to these chemical synaptic connections, electrical synapses exist between adjacent VB (DB) neurons and between adjacent muscle cells (White et al., 1986; Chen et al., 2006). In the model, the ventral cord circuit (White et al., 1976, 1986; Chen et al., 2006) is simplified to a single AVB command neuron that drives a series of N = 12 repeating units, each containing one motor neuron of each class DB<sub>n</sub>, VB<sub>n</sub>, DD<sub>n</sub>, and VD<sub>n</sub>, with n = 1, . . ., N (see Figure 1C). Note the inclusion of neural inhibition from VD to VB, that is partially consistent with the connectivity data (Chen et al., 2006). Within each unit, B-class neurons receive a constant-current input from AVB, switching the entire circuit on and off. D-class neurons are modeled as passive (linear) elements. Postulated stretch-receptor-mediated proprioception in B-class neurons forms the fundamental oscillatory mechanism of the model. Each DB (VB) neuron integrates stretch-receptor currents from the dorsal (ventral) side, both locally and posteriorly, along its axon. Finally, all electrical synapses except those between AVB and VB/DB are neglected in our model. Indeed, a modeling study on the role of intermuscle coupling (Boyle and Cohen, 2008) suggested that the coupling may be too weak to have any observable effect and"

For simplicity, a binary variable S = {0, 1} denotes off and on states (and abstractly represents polarized and depolarized membrane potentials). Each B-neuron turns on in response to a supra-threshold input signal which includes internal activation from stretch receptors (see below) and synaptic inputs. B-neurons turn off when this signal falls below some threshold. Hysteresis is implemented by making the activation/deactivation threshold state dependent (see arrows in Figure 7A). Given the short time scale of RMD neurons, which we estimate to be \u226410 ms (see Figure 2 of Mellem et al., 2008), it is reasonable to model these neurons as instantaneous."

For example, what would a model that was optimized for replicating crawling behavior yield when placed in virtual water, or vice versa?

Indeed, the only changes necessary to obtain these different behaviors are to the effective drag coefficients that define the model environment.

To understand the common oscillatory mechanism underpinning these behaviors, it is helpful to follow an oscillation in a single neural unit connected to a section of body. Consider such a system that is initialized with both DB and VB states off, with the body shape completely straight. Switching the AVB input on drives VB above its activation threshold, and causes the ventral muscles to contract, stretching the dorsal side. At some point the dorsal stretch will be sufficient to activate DB and VD. Ventral inhibition resets VB (switching it off). At this stage bending will reverse, with the dorsal side contracting and the ventral side stretching, until the dorsal contraction drops the input to DB below the deactivation threshold, turning it off and indirectly releasing VB from inhibition. Note the importance of dorso-ventral asymmetry that allows the ventral side to be activated first and to de-activate only in response to ventral inhibition (with AVB on)."

In our model, the neural units are indirectly coupled through the shape of the body (i.e., through posterior stretch receptors) and through the physical properties of the body and environment. The relative importance of these contributions depends on the properties of the medium (Boyle, 2010; Fang-Yen et al., 2010). First let us consider highly resistive environments, such as agar. With the body initialized along a straight line, as above, all VB neurons are on. During forward motion, the worm's body exhibits a decreasing undulation amplitude from head to tail. Accordingly, in the model, ventral muscles exert a contractile force with a decreasing gradient toward the tail. Thus the head is the most strongly activated and will bend first, pulling the worm forward slightly and allowing more of the body to bend. Sufficient bending of the head will eventually activate dorsal neurons and bending will reverse. It is the delay in bending (rather than in actuation) imposed by strong lateral drag forces that gives rise to the crawling wavelength. In less resistive media such as water, neural units cannot rely on physical coupling via the environment for entrainment, so the synchronizing effect of non-local stretch receptor signals must determine the spatial wavelength."

We found that both the post layout and the properties of the filler medium can affect the locomotion behavior. When the filler medium has low resistance (i.e., water) the undulation frequency is high, but the amplitude and wavelength depend on the post layout (Movies S7\u2013S9 in Supplementary Material). In contrast, when the filler medium is highly resistive (i.e., agar) the behavior tends to be crawling-like. In cases where the post layout is roughly compatible with crawling, the locomotion waveform adapts to these constraints (Movie S10 in Supplementary Material). However, when the layout is not compatible, the posts essentially become obstacles (Movie S11 in Supplementary Material)."

Interestingly, previous models of locomotion have introduced non-linearities elsewhere in the locomotion circuit. In the case of Bryden and Cohen (2008) for example, stretch receptor conductances have strong non-linearity that effectively leads to \"on-off\" neuronal states, even though the underlying equations were of a graded potential neuron.

The only inhibition in this circuit is mediated by D-class GABAergic neurons. Individual D-class neurons receive input from both A- and B-class neurons. They inhibit muscles, and in some cases also motoneurons of class D, on either side, and of classes A and B, on the ventral side only (Chen et al., 2006; Boyle, 2010). The connectivity diagram of these inhibitory D-class neurons suggests involvement in both forward and backward locomotion (White et al., 1986; Chen et al., 2006). The function of D-class neurons can be knocked out through mutation of genes required in the GABA pathway (McIntire et al., 1993b), by targeted killing of D-class neurons (Walthall et al., 1993) and by laser axotomy (Yanik et al., 2004), yielding essentially the same so-called shrinker phenotype (Hodgkin, 1983) in all cases: When touched on the head, wild type worms will back up, whereas worms whose GABA pathway is defective will contract muscles along both sides of their bodies. Thus, D-class neurons are implicated in backward motion, or at least its initiation. In contrast, forward locomotion in these mutants or D-ablated worms is described either as wild type (Walthall et al., 1993; Yanik et al., 2004), or nearly wild type with a reduction in amplitude (McIntire et al., 1993b).

Interestingly, muscle inhibition does not appear to offer an appropriate resetting mechanism in the context of a sensory feedback based oscillatory mechanism in which B-class neurons are depolarized in response to local stretch (Boyle, 2010). The role of a resetting mechanism is to ensure that when a given neuron becomes depolarized, its opposite counterpart is immediately repolarized \u2013 something that is easily achieved through direct neural inhibition. In contrast, if the opposite muscle is inhibited instead, the resulting relaxation would indirectly depolarize the opposite neuron (via stretch receptors) thus delaying, rather than accelerating, its repolarization."

Previously, the necessary extent of proprioceptive receptive fields has been considered only for crawling-like motor patterns (Niebur and Erd\u00f6s, 1991; Bryden and Cohen, 2008), but we find that our model requires integration of proprioceptive inputs over up to half a body length. Indeed, our model suggests that the length of this receptive field should be determined by the longest (i.e., swimming) wavelength of undulations. That said, B-class axons in *C. elegans* do not extend to half a body length, suggesting additional mechanisms may be at play. For example, modifications to body properties, different stretch receptor distributions and (possibly non-linear) conductances, and additional proprioceptive pathways (other than via B-neurons) may all contribute to reducing the minimum required receptive field."

In line with data on RMD neurons, we have chosen to implement such bistability via state-dependent activation and deactivation of the B-class motor neurons. In addition, some form of strong non-linearity is likely to be needed somewhere along the neuromuscular pathway to avoid muscle co-activation on the two sides of the body. In other words, for wild type worms performing forward locomotion it is reasonable to expect that when one side is contracting, the other side should relax. In fact, RMD neurons exhibit such strong non-linearities, and we conjecture that B-class neurons may exhibit similar behavior. Thus, we have implemented bistability by defining binary activation states of B-class motor neurons. To validate these assumptions against available data (Liu et al., 2009), we also presented a complementary conductance-based model of B-class neurons. The ability to fine tune the activation of motor neurons within effective bands of \"off\" and \"on\" activation states may confer important advantages to the worm in richer, more realistic forms of motor pattern generation. However further experiments would be needed to ascertain whether B-class neurons exhibit any bistable behavior."

Consequently, an additional mechanism must be invoked in order to reset the activation of the ventral side. Perhaps surprisingly, muscle inhibition by D-class neurons is not likely to perform this role (Boyle, 2010).
