We survey the basic anatomical\nfeatures, common technical approaches, and important discoveries in C. elegans research. Key to studying C. elegans\nhas been the ability to address biological problems genetically, using both forward and reverse genetics, both at the\nlevel of the entire organism and at the level of the single, identi\ufb01ed cell.

With the simplicity and power of prokaryotic genetics in mind, he proposed that a nematode (round worm), Caenorhabditis briggsae, would be an ideal system in which to tackle these problems. Later, he settled on the related nematode C. elegans as the focus of his efforts because the elegans strain grew better than the briggsae isolate in Brenner\u2019s laboratory (F\u00e9lix 2008). Today, C. elegans is actively studied in over a thousand laboratories worldwide (www.wormbase.org) with over 1200 C. elegans research articles published each year for the last 5 years.\n\nC. elegans is a tiny, free-living nematode found worldwide. Newly hatched larvae are 0.25 mm long and adults are 1 mm long. Their small size means that the animals usually are observed with either dissecting microscopes, which generally allow up to 100X magnification, or compound microscopes, which allow up to 1000X magnification. The dissecting microscope is used to observe worms on Petri dishes (Figure 1, A and B) as they move, eat, develop, mate, and lay eggs (for movies showing these features, see http://labs.bio.unc.edu/Goldstein/movies.html). A compound or confocal microscope allows observation at much finer resolution (Figure 1C), permitting researchers to perform experiments that address questions related to cell development and function at single-cell resolution. Because C. elegans is transparent, individual cells and subcellular details are easily visualized using Nomarski (differential interference contrast, DIC) optics (Figure 1C). Enhanced detail can be discerned by using fluorescent proteins to tag proteins or subcellular compartments (Figure 1D). Fluorescent proteins can also be used to study developmental processes, screen for mutants affecting cell development and function, isolate cells, and characterize protein interactions in vivo (Chalfi et al. 1994; Boulin et al. 2006; Feinberg et al. 2008).\n\nC. elegans has a rapid life cycle (3 days at 25\u00b0 from egg to egg-laying adult) and exists primarily as a self-fertilizing hermaphrodite, although males arise at a frequency of ,0.2% (Figure 2). These features have helped to make C. elegans a powerful model of choice for eukaryotic genetic studies. In addition, because the animal has an invariant number of somatic cells, researchers have been able to track the fate of every cell between fertilization and adulthood in live animals and to generate a complete cell lineage (Sulston and Horvitz 1977; Kimble and Hirsh 1979; Sulston et al. 1983). Researchers have also reconstructed the shape of all C. elegans cells from electron micrographs, including each of the 302 neurons of the adult hermaphrodite (White et al. 1986) and the posterior mating circuit in the adult male (Jarrell et al. 2012). These reconstructions have provided the most complete \u201cwiring diagrams\u201d of any nervous system and have helped to explain how sexual dimorphism affects neuronal circuits. Moreover, because of the invariant wild-type cell lineage and neuroanatomy of C. elegans, mutations that give rise to developmental and behavioral defects are readily identified in genetic screens.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4141, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "21f44073-ab1a-4af1-ad8b-881ec00ee2d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "21f44073-ab1a-4af1-ad8b-881ec00ee2d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 2](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3b801afc-9705-46da-ab54-61803bdd0b7a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 2](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "hash": "c6f7544bfbeb3d6ba688cdb431e718b98a0a37bdb9bcb77ddd9f509881bb7ae0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b9493c6c-b23f-41df-bc0a-b6e3c6e932d2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 2](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "hash": "d6758d435527a2e11f2477563f5499f9b03e276801cb893adf689c8dc21095c7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "1983).

Kratz.\n\n# C. elegans Basics\n\n# Growth and maintenance\n\nC. elegans, although often mischaracterized as a soil nematode, can most easily be isolated from rotting vegetable matter, which contains an ample supply of their bacterial food source (Barri\u00e8re and F\u00e9lix 2014). In the laboratory, animals are normally grown on agar plates containing a lawn of the bacterium *Escherichia coli*. Once the animals deplete the bacteria, they utilize their fat supply. Without food, the development of young larval-stage animals is arrested.\n\nAs a result of entering this stasis, animals can survive for at least a month (often starved plates can be usefully kept for up to 6 months at 15\u00b0), and as stocks, they do not require constant feeding. Whenever healthy, growing animals are needed, a piece of the agar from the old plate can be transferred to a new plate with bacteria. The animals move to the new bacteria and resume their development.\n\nSeveral other features greatly facilitate the maintenance of C. elegans stocks and their experimental use. First, because C. elegans is a self-fertilizing hermaphrodite (see the following section), a single animal can populate a plate. Second, animal populations can be frozen for years and revived when needed. Third, the animal\u2019s small size means that many can be grown in a small space. Fourth, animals can be grown at temperatures ranging from 12\u00b0 to 25\u00b0; their Q10 for growth is 2 (that is, an increase of 10\u00b0 speeds up growth twofold).\n\nGrowth at different temperatures makes it possible to control the rate of animal development and assists in the isolation and use of temperature-sensitive mutants. Continual growth above 25\u00b0 is not possible because the animals become sterile. The upper temperature limit can be a problem if animals are kept on bench tops (instead of temperature-controlled incubators) in rooms that are too warm. Shorter exposures to higher temperatures are possible for heat shock experiments and to increase production of.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3109, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a7e01f0-79e5-44b3-82d8-a9bd62c16803": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a7e01f0-79e5-44b3-82d8-a9bd62c16803", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 4](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b67d8b31-ad2c-4e4a-abee-bb21279efe2e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 4](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "hash": "028dfa51559e2edc3965650c860b9fffd6debaf1042123ad6eee8204aa4b27a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "76c91f33-097d-49e6-b766-90b14d9c8b52", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "86814cc9440a171d6f0bcb92140bc71daafb09f7df639b167aee22fdc30c1544", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Adult L4 Embryos\n\nFigure 2 Life cycle of C. elegans. Animals increase in size throughout the four larval stages, but individual sexes are not easily distinguished until the L4 stage. At the L4 stage, hermaphrodites have a tapered tail and the developing vulva (white arrowhead) can be seen as a clear half circle in the center of the ventral side. The males have a wider tail (black arrowhead) but no discernible fan at this stage. In adults, the two sexes can be distinguished by the wider girth and tapered tail of the hermaphrodite and slimmer girth and fan-shaped tail (black arrowhead) of the male.

Fifth, animals can be synchronized by isolating newly hatched larvae or by treating gravid adults with bleach (which decontaminates by killing everything but embryos) and isolating eggs, which are resistant to bleach treatment. Sixth, to facilitate biochemical studies, animals can be grown in bulk in liquid medium. \u201cWorm sorters\u201d such as the COPAS Biosorter are also available to quickly select large quantities of individual worms with desired characteristics. Finally, one does not need especially expensive equipment beyond a good dissecting microscope and a compound microscope to work with this animal. Overall, the animals are inexpensive and convenient to maintain.\n\n# Sexual forms and their importance\n\nWild-type C. elegans has two sexual forms: self-fertilizing hermaphrodites and males (Figure 2 and Figure 3, A and B). The gonad of hermaphrodites forms an ovotestis that first produces haploid amoeboid sperm that are stored in the spermatheca in the L4 stage and then near adulthood the germ line switches fate to produce much larger oocytes. Essentially hermaphrodites are females whose gonads temporarily produce sperm before they produce oocytes. Hermaphrodites can produce up to 300 self-progeny that are fertilized by the stored sperm. If mated with males, hermaphrodites are capable of producing 1000 offspring, indicating that hermaphrodite-produced sperm is a limiting factor in self-fertilization. Both sexes are diploid for the five autosomal chromosomes. The sexes differ in that hermaphrodites have two X chromosomes and males have a single X chromosome\u2014C. elegans has no Y chromosome\u2014and the genotype of males is referred to as XO. Sex is determined by the X to autosome (X:A) ratio (Zarkower 2006). The majority of offspring produced by self-fertilization are hermaphrodites; only 0.1\u20130.2% of the progeny are males due to rare meiotic nondisjunction of the X chromosome.\n\nBecause hermaphrodites make their own sperm, in genetic crosses self-progeny (oocytes fertilized by the hermaphrodite\u2019s sperm) need to be distinguished from cross-progeny. For example, when hermaphrodites homozygous for a recessive mutation causing a visible mutant phenotype are mated to wild-type males, the self-progeny hermaphrodites show the mutant phenotype and the cross-progeny hermaphrodites do not. Self-fertilizing hermaphrodites provide several advantages for genetic analysis. First, self-fertilization (often referred to as selfing) simplifies maintaining stocks because a single animal can give rise to an entire population. Second, as Brenner (1974) has written, \u201cthe animals are driven to homozygosity,\u201d i.e., populations of hermaphrodites tend to lose heterozygotes (because hermaphrodites cannot mate with other hermaphrodites). Thus, strains that are mutagenized are essentially isogenic. Third, selfing follows the standard Mendelian rules of segregation, so a parent that is heterozygous for a recessive trait will produce the standard 1:2:1 pattern of segregation, such that 25% of the progeny will be homozygous for the mutant allele and display the autosomal recessive trait.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4018, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76c91f33-097d-49e6-b766-90b14d9c8b52": {"__data__": {"id_": "76c91f33-097d-49e6-b766-90b14d9c8b52", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 4](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b67d8b31-ad2c-4e4a-abee-bb21279efe2e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 4](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "hash": "028dfa51559e2edc3965650c860b9fffd6debaf1042123ad6eee8204aa4b27a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3a7e01f0-79e5-44b3-82d8-a9bd62c16803", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 4](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "hash": "3428b36048455ce8b10c22d7fe4098096287b43ecec00511c9b8c4e4047fbb64", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Self-fertilizing hermaphrodites provide several advantages for genetic analysis.

In fact, only 11 of the 302 nerve cells of the hermaphrodite: eight ADF, ASG, ASI, and ASJ neurons, which when killed as a group cause the animals to become dauer larvae (Bargmann and Horvitz 1991), the two CAN cells (Forrester and Garriga 1997), and the M4 neuron in the pharynx (Avery and Horvitz 1989) are known to be essential to support development to the reproductive adult stage.

Such screens have been exceptionally useful and informative. For example, lin-12 mutants (C. elegans nomenclature is outlined in Box 1) are defective in vulval development and components of the LIN-12/Notch signaling pathway have been identified with both suppressor and enhancer screens (Greenwald and Kovall 2013).\n\nMales are important because they allow the exchange of genetic material needed to generate animals with different genetic compositions and to map genes. Indeed, the animal has evolved to take advantage of the genetic contribution of rare males by using male (outcross) sperm before using hermaphrodite (self) sperm (Ward and Carrel 1979). Thus, if males are capable of mating, cross-progeny prevail (to help males find hermaphrodites, researchers use Petri plates with a small spot of bacteria).\n\n# Life cycle\n\nC. elegans embryogenesis takes 16 hr at 20\u00b0 (all of the subsequent times are also for development at 20\u00b0) (Figure 2). A virtually impermeable eggshell is made after fertilization, allowing the embryo to develop completely independent of the mother. However, embryos are usually retained within the hermaphrodite until about the 24-cell stage at which time they are laid. The hermaphrodite embryo hatches with 558 nuclei (some nuclei are in multinuclear syncytia, so the cell count is lower) and becomes a first stage (L1) larva. The animals begin to eat and develop through four larval stages (L1\u2013L4). The L1 stage is 16 hr long; the other stages are 12 hr long. Each stage ends with a sleep-like period of inactivity called lethargus (Raizen et al. 2008) in which a new cuticle (outer collagenous layer) is made. Lethargus ends with the molting of the old cuticle. Approximately 12 hr after the L4 molt, adult hermaphrodites begin producing progeny for a period of 2\u20133 days until they have utilized all of their self-produced sperm; additional progeny can be generated if the sperm-depleted hermaphrodite mates with a male. After the reproductive period, hermaphrodites can live several more weeks before dying of senescence.\n\nWhen bacteria are depleted and the animals are crowded, L2 larvae activate an alternative life cycle (Hu 2007) and molt into an alternative L3 larval stage called the \u201cdauer\u201d larva (\u201cdauer\u201d in German means \u201clasting\u201d; the signal is actually processed by L1 animals, but its results are not seen until the so-called \u201cL2d\u201d stage; Golden and Riddle 1984).

Self-fertilization means that after hermaphrodites (P0s) are mutagenized, any mutant alleles (except dominant lethals) can be maintained through self-propagation in first-generation (F1) progeny, and second-generation (F2) progeny, etc. without mating. This property makes obtaining these progeny easy. In practice, C. elegans researchers screen for mutations anywhere in the genome (instead of using balanced strains to mutagenize single chromosomes) in a single mutagenesis and determine linkage afterward. A second genetic advantage of C. elegans is that it grows quickly. Since animals take 3 days at 25\u00b0 (3.5).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3023, "end_char_idx": 4783, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e83bb83-bbb0-4d61-8c5d-463d6ab35f4d": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e83bb83-bbb0-4d61-8c5d-463d6ab35f4d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 6](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c669dffe-a489-46f5-8fa6-b820babdea3e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 6](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "hash": "93f90e9804dd8945f168fa2464674d2f604c2d77d5cd5a3cf6c703ac507ba906", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9ff1b43c-ddd0-4d41-bfb9-cc5fd56a10e3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "254d7d2b0b733434a4b81ee274b48163e663a33d2a489ff63d85e6c09ea4862f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Box 1.

Cosmids, proteins, phenotypes, and strain names are not written in italics.\n\n# Mutation (allele) names:\n\nThe wild-type allele of any gene is designated by an italicized plus sign1. Mutant alleles are represented by 1-3 lowercase letters, which indicate specific laboratories, followed by a number. All gene and allele symbols are italicized, e.g., unc-54, e678, and mn5. The homozygous genotype is represented by a single copy of the allele name (e678). A heterozygous condition is indicated with a slash, e.g., e364/1, e364/e1099. Chromosomal abnormalities are indicated by one or two letters after the lab code, e.g., mnDp30 is a duplication, nDf6 is a deletion (called a deficiency), and szT1 is a translocation. One or two letters may be added after the allele name to indicate particular properties conveyed by the mutation e.g. temperature-sensitivity (ts), amber (am), revertant (r), dominant (d), and semidominant (sd). When a gene has more than one mutation, such as could result from the intragenic reversion of a mutant allele, both the old and new mutations are indicated, e.g., intragenic reversion of e1498 could yield e1498u124r.\n\n# Gene names:\n\nGenes are designated by 3 or 4 lower case letters, a dash, and a number (all italicized), e.g. lon-2 and ensh-1. To distinguish alleles of the same gene, the allele names are placed in parentheses with no space between the gene and allele name, e.g., mec-7(e1343) and mec-7(e1506). Genes that have been identified as an open reading frame (ORF) through bioinformatics approaches get a systematic gene identification (e.g. ZK154.3) until subsequent studies prompts them to be given a gene name. The upstream promoter region of a gene is indicated by the gene name followed by a \u201cp.\u201d The promoter and the protein-coding names are separated by two colons as are parts of fusion proteins.

The letters indicate the laboratory that constructed the strain (http://www.cbs.umn.edu/research/resources/cgc/lab-head). None of these symbols are italicized. Because a given strain can carry more than one mutation, strain names can be thought of as shorthand to describe animals carrying complicated genotypes. Genes (and/or alleles) in strains with several mutations are listed in chromosome and then map order with genes on the same chromosome separated by spaces and genes on different chromosomes separated by semi-colons. The italicized name of the chromosome can also be included, e.g., lon-2 (e678) mec-7(e1506) X, unc-54; myo-3, and e364; e66; u38/szT1. szT1 is one of many balancer chromosomes that are often used to maintain mutations that are lethal as homozygotes but viable as heterozygotes. For strains that contain reporter genes, there are two typical designations. The reporters are named for specific laboratories similar to mutant alleles, and they are further named according to whether the reporter gene is maintained extrachromosomally on a multicopy array using an \u201cEx\u201d label (e.g. evEx1) or is maintained by integrating the sequence (in most cases randomly) into the genome using an \u201cIs\u201d label (e.g. muIs35).\n\n392 A.

In addition, the ability to freeze and recover C. elegans makes it possible to preserve mutant strains without worrying that they have acquired unwanted suppressors, other modifiers, or additional background mutations or have lost important mutations, particularly if they are maintained as heterozygotes. Therefore, much less effort needs to be devoted to strain maintenance.\n\nThe traditional use of genetics in C. elegans (often referred to as \u201cforward genetics\u201d) begins with a screen or selection to find mutants with a particular phenotype followed by inference of the wild-type role of the gene from the nature of the mutant phenotype. Jorgensen and Mango (2002) have reviewed the many types of screens and selections used in C. elegans to identify mutations resulting in novel phenotypes (including conditional phenotypes) and mutations that modify (either enhancing or suppressing) existing phenotypes. A variety of mutagens have been used (Kutscher and Shaham 2014), including ethane methylsulfonate (EMS), an alkylating reagent that causes principally GC-to-AT transition mutations and small deletions, used by Brenner in his initial studies (Brenner 1974).\n\nOnce mutant strains have been obtained and shown to be true-breeding, i.e., give mutant individuals in the next generation, they can be mapped using classical genetic tools (Brenner 1974). Originally, mapping involved linkage crosses to identify the chromosome containing the mutation followed by multiple three-factor crosses to refine its map position. Once a map position had been determined, the mutated gene could be identified molecularly (using the physical map of overlapping genomic clones) by transformation rescue of the mutant phenotype by the wild-type gene (Evans 2006; Merritt et al. 2010; Schweinsberg and Grant 2013). Transformation requires injection of DNA into the syncytial (multinucleated) gonad, where it is incorporated into the nucleus of some developing gametes (Mello and Fire 1995). Transposon-tagged mutations were also used to isolate the DNA of the mutated gene, allowing for its molecular identification (e.g., Greenwald 1985). The entire process of cloning a gene could easily take a year.\n\nToday, however, the process of connecting a mutant phenotype to a gene is much more rapid due to advances in whole-genome sequencing (Doitsidou et al. 2010; Zuryn et al. 2010; Minevich et al. 2012). Mutants derived from the standard wild-type strain (called N2) are crossed to a wild-type strain obtained in Hawaii (CB4856), whose sequence differs from N2 at many positions [one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) per 91 656 kb; Swan et al. 2002]. Mutants reisolated after the cross have retained N2 sequences in the vicinity of the mutation, whereas N2 and Hawaiian sequences randomly segregate at other loci. Whole-genome sequencing can reveal the location of N2 DNA and lead, hopefully, to a small number of candidate genes that can be tested as above. This process can be done in a number of weeks and, as before, transformation rescue (or complementation testing) provides evidence that the correct gene has been identified.\n\nResearchers can also use a known gene sequence to obtain mutant strains, a process called \u201creverse genetics\u201d (Ahringer 2006). One of the first ways to do such reverse genetics was the generation of strains that deleted all or part of a target gene (Lesa 2006). Animals were mutagenized with trimethylpsoralen to cause deletions and large numbers of individual F2 animals were used to establish lines. Pooling DNA from these strains and amplifying the several pools of DNA with PCR primers, designed to amplify a deleted but not wild-type gene, could identify which line had a deletion mutation (a process called sibling selection). Further selection within the line could establish a homozygous strain containing the deletion mutation.\n\nWhole-genome sequencing has enabled a very rapid way of obtaining mutations. In a study dubbed the \u201cmillion mutation project\u201d (Thompson et al. 2013), animals were mutated by EMS and/or N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) and F2 progeny (from different P0 parents) were grown. Over 2000 healthy strains were established from these mutageneses.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4367, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "94e8561b-aecc-4360-b83d-f2c19de5f947": {"__data__": {"id_": "94e8561b-aecc-4360-b83d-f2c19de5f947", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 7](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "64262185-a368-459a-8089-95dac0009445", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 7](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "hash": "caa1c072b81e7b835848e850a9a2b08f6b72e5cbc0197f6fb686065c4df6a4ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "22b26c16-78b1-46b6-9744-ec18d5cf657c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 7](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "hash": "d4f4ea9d244cec647f17c996cb9bd99fa6801e67d304820dc8bdabc04bcecd59", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Animals were mutagenized with trimethylpsoralen to cause deletions and large numbers of individual F2 animals were used to establish lines.

Over 2000 healthy strains were established from these mutageneses. Whole-genome sequencing of each strain showed that, on average, there were 400 mutations per strain. Altogether these strains had over 800,000 unique mutations. Since the genome contains 20,000 genes, each gene has been mutated an average of eight times. The results are available in WormBase and the strains can be obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (Table 1). Recent advances in efficient genome-editing methods (TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9) in C. elegans now allow investigators to create targeted mutations in nearly any location in the genome in any genetic background (Fr\u00f8kj\u00e6r-Jensen 2013; Waaijers and Boxem 2014). These gene editing techniques, particularly CRISPR/Cas9, enable rapid methods to mutate and interrogate C. elegans genes, and new approaches based on them are being introduced.\n\nMutant-like phenotypes can also be obtained using RNA interference (RNAi), the use of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to reduce gene activity (Fire et al. 1998, see Ahringer 2006). The added discovery that RNAi can be produced by soaking the animals in a solution of dsRNA (Tabara et al. 1998) or by feeding the animals bacteria that generate specific dsRNA (Timmons and Fire 1998) means the entire genome can be easily and systematically interrogated for genes needed for specific functions. Such genome-wide screens using libraries of bacterial strains are common and easily done.\n\n# Why Choose C. elegans?\n\nIn addition to being a powerful system for genetic studies, C. elegans has many inherent advantages as a model for eukaryotic biology.

Although not usually mentioned, another favorable feature of C. elegans is the organisms are quite benign to humans. In fact, because they cannot grow at body temperature, they cannot grow in humans. Some nematodes, e.g., Ascaris suum, induce a debilitating allergic reaction and must be studied in ventilated hoods (Kennedy 2013; A. O. Stretton, personal communication). As far as we are aware, allergic reactions to C. elegans have not been documented.\n\nStudies of cell and developmental biology that use C. elegans are greatly aided by the transparency of the animal, which allows researchers to examine development and changes due to mutations or altered environments at the level of a single, identified cell within the context of the entire living organism. Thus, many biological problems can be studied \u201cin miniature\u201d at the single-cell level, instead of in large numbers of cells in heterogeneous tissues. Transparency also enables a wealth of studies in living animals utilizing fluorescent protein reporters (Figure 1D and Figure 4B). By labeling cells and proteins in living cells, fluorescent proteins enable genetic screens to identify mutants defective in various cellular processes. In addition, fluorescent protein-based reporters (e.g., Cameleon and gCaMP3; Figure 4C), which fluoresce in response to calcium flux, provide neuron-specific detection of calcium flux under a fluorescent microscope and therefore allow researchers to measure electrophysiological activity in vivo (Kerr 2006). Furthermore, mapping of cell\u2013cell and synaptic contacts can be accomplished by expressing complementary fragments of GFP in different cells (GRASP; Feinberg et al. 2008). Transparency also means that optogenetic tools, which alter the activity of individual neurons, are particularly effective in C. elegans (Husson et al. 2013).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4077, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c21b77cf-7ef9-446b-867f-0997bda97efb": {"__data__": {"id_": "c21b77cf-7ef9-446b-867f-0997bda97efb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 8](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aa88fe03-0594-4896-b972-dd3db7ad71e8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 8](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "hash": "799dfb25250e3e2a87ac1d645aee212ec55c7c9c9ee0953aee822a194c10ee62", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f21352f8-2c41-4b2a-823d-04f0e4b8529d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 8](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "hash": "3b7cb84d5b42319182b1903b9f340fcec39763677c82fbc673554bc5628674ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Transparency also enables a wealth of studies in living animals utilizing fluorescent protein reporters (Figure 1D and Figure 4B).

Other mutations affect the struts formed between layers of the adult cuticle, resulting in fluid-filled muscles that control eating (pharyngeal muscles), egg laying (vulval and uterine muscles and the contractile gonad sheath), mating (male-specific tail muscles), and defecation (enteric muscles).\n\n# At the end of each larval stage (Figure 2), C. elegans sheds its cuticle and secretes a new one to accommodate the growing organism.\n\nGenes involved in cuticle formation are regulated so that the cuticle is reestablished after each molt.\n\n# Studying the epidermis has led to insights in early cell movements, wound healing, cell\u2013cell fusions, and the establishment of epithelial layers in developing embryos (Chisholm and Hardin 2005; Podbilewicz 2006).\n\nAs the C. elegans, the epidermis is a model for the innate immune response to pathogens and for repair after a physical wound such as a needle puncture. The wounded epidermis upregulates both Ca++ signaling to direct actin polymerization for repair and innate immune signaling pathways to help promote survival after injury (Xu et al. 2012).\n\n# The cell\u2013cell fusion events leading to the multinucleate epidermis and genes important for this process have been studied (Podbilewicz 2006).\n\nThis work has supported the idea that repression of fusion in some cells may be just as important for proper development as activation of cell fusion in other cells (Podbilewicz 2006).\n\n# Muscles\u2014controlling animal movement\n\nJust interior and connected to the epidermis are four quadrants (95 cells) of body-wall muscles that run along the length of the body (Figure 3).

Researchers also have investigated a variety of behaviors, both simple and complex, including chemotaxis, thermotaxis, several responses to touch, male-specific mating rituals, social feeding, and both associative and nonassociative learning (Bargmann 2006; Hart 2006; Barr and Garcia 2006; Ardiel and Rankin 2010; Figure 4E). C. elegans also experiences periods of restful inactivity that are similar to aspects of mammalian sleep (Raizen et al. 2008).\n\nThe nervous system of the adult hermaphrodite has 302 neurons (Sulston and Horvitz 1977; White et al. 1986); that of the adult male has 383 neurons (Figure 4; WormAtlas.org). The majority of neuronal cell bodies are arranged in a few ganglia in the head, in the ventral cord, and in the tail (the specialized male tail has the majority of the extra neurons). Most of the neurons have a simple structure with one or two neurites (or processes) exiting from the cell body, but a few cells, such as the FLP and PVD mechanosensory neurons, have elaborately branched neurites (Dong et al. 2013). Except for sensory dendrites, which are often easy to identify, most neurites cannot be distinguished as axons or dendrites because they both give and receive synapses (although they are often referred to as \u201caxons\u201d). The neurites form synapses to each other in four major areas: the nerve ring (which encircles the pharynx), the ventral nerve cord, the dorsal nerve cord, and the neuropil of the tail. In addition to neurons, C. elegans has several glia-like support cells, which are primarily associated with sensory neurons, but are not as numerous as in vertebrates (Oikonomou and Shaham 2011).\n\nNerve conduction in C. elegans appears to be primarily passive. No sodium-dependent action potentials have been detected in neurons (Goodman et al. 1998) and the genome has no genes for voltage-gated sodium channels (Bargmann 1998).

Indeed, many neurons are essentially isopotential; changes in voltage are experienced virtually instantaneously by the entire cell (Goodman et al. 1998), so action potentials may not be necessary (Lockery and Goodman 2009). Neurons express a wide variety of ion channels (Hobert 2013), including an unexpectedly large number of genes encoding potassium channels (Salkoff et al. 2005).\n\nC. elegans neurons make more than 7000 chemical synapses and gap junction connections (White et al. 1986). Unlike in vertebrate nervous systems, C. elegans neurons do not send terminal branches with boutons to make synapses. Most of the connections are made en passant (side by side as neurites pass each other), although many bilaterally symmetrical neurons join their tips together with gap junctions at the midline and some motor neurons similarly join with homologs end to end. Nematodes are unusual in that motor neurons do not send processes that synapse onto muscle; instead muscles send cellular projections to motor neurons to receive synapses. Chemical synapses are identified in electron micrographs by presynaptic darkening and synaptic vesicles; postsynaptic specializations are not obvious (Figure 4D). C. elegans uses many of the most common neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine, glutamate, g-amino butyric acid (GABA), dopamine, and serotonin and has several receptors for their detection (Hobert 2013). Gap junctions are detected in electron micrographs as parallel membranes in the closely apposed neurons. As with other invertebrates, gap junctions are formed from innexins (Starich et al. 2001).\n\nIn addition to the chemical synaptic and gap junction connections, C. elegans neurons are modulated by numerous neuroendocrine signals (Li and Kim 2008).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2938, "end_char_idx": 5397, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28236655-a096-45ef-be44-fd5ad275829e": {"__data__": {"id_": "28236655-a096-45ef-be44-fd5ad275829e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 12](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1fda165-26d7-4ca3-944b-3192037cb044", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 12](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "hash": "32c829aec0f4ddb2c0590a84fb03d6855a0cccdd7e6bd3d0fd94ddbae3acf61b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "43e2ddd5-132a-48b1-b895-8df4accc4c66", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "252a3010ecf151784a25bf6a1e6659f8dde732b10ce610a249f05fee18a7f8f6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Figure 6\n\nC. elegans mutant phenotypes. Wild-type animals (WT) are approximately 1 mm long with a smooth exterior, and they move in a sinusoidal pattern. Rolling (Rol) animals twist their body like a corkscrew and as a result often remain in the same region moving in a circular pattern. Dumpy (Dpy) animals are shorter than wild type. Multivulvae (Muv) hermaphrodites have protrusions along the ventral side (white arrowheads) where vulvae form but are not able to attach to the uterus. Strain sources: D. Eisenmann and A. Golden.\n\n# Reproductive tissue\u2014sex-specific anatomy\n\nThe C. elegans sexes display several obvious anatomical differences in the somatic gonad, secondary sexual structures, and body size (Figure 2, Figure 3, A and B). The somatic gonad is located in the center of the body alongside the intestine. In hermaphrodites the gonad consists of two mirror-image U-shaped tubes; in males the gonad consists of a single U-shaped lobe (Figure 3). Both gonads house the germline where the oocytes and sperm develop (Hubbard and Greenstein 2005). The somatic gonad and the germline develop together during larval stages until animals reach maturity at the young adult stage. A powerful advantage for studies of the C. elegans germline is that one can observe all stages of meiosis at once as the germline is a visible gradient of development (Hubbard and Greenstein 2005; Kimble and Crittenden 2005; Figure 5B). Studying the germline has been a model for meiosis, gamete development, fertilization, stem cell biology, and even tumor formation (Kimble and Crittenden 2005).\n\nSecondary sexual mating structures are the vulva in hermaphrodites and the fan-shaped tail in males (Emmons 2005; Herman 2006). The vulva develops in the center of the epidermis on the ventral side of the hermaphrodite and is the conduit for sperm entry from the male and egg laying from the uterus (Sternberg 2005). Studying vulval morphogenesis has provided insights into signaling by the Notch, EGF, and Wnt pathways that coordinate the spatiotemporal development of the organ. Defects in these pathways can lead to animals with no vulva [the egg-laying defective (Egl) phenotype] or with many vulval-like protrusions [the multivulva (Muv) phenotype; Figure 6]. In many cases these animals cannot lay eggs (or mate), and their progeny develop internally, hatch within the hermaphrodite, and create the \u201cbag-of-worms\u201d phenotype whereby the larvae consume the mother (a process called endotoky matricidia). This phenotype, which also occurs when wild-type adult hermaphrodites are starved, has been used to identify numerous egg-laying defective mutants. For example, details of Ras GTPase/MAP Kinase signaling have been elucidated through the identification of mutants in enhancer/suppressor screens of vulval phenotypes (Sundaram 2013).\n\nAdult males are thinner than hermaphrodites (due to their smaller gonad and the absence of developing embryos), and their tails are flattened into a fan of cuticular material with 18 projections of neurons and associated support cells called rays (Figure 3B). As with vulval development, the development of male tail structures and their associated muscles involves the coordinated action of multiple signaling pathways (Emmons 2005). Interestingly, the same signaling pathways are used in both males and hermaphrodites in the development of reproductive tissues (e.g., Wnt signaling), yet these pathways produce very different sex-specific organs and structures (Emmons 2005).\n\nThe outward morphology of males and hermaphrodites is determined by a regulatory cascade that controls the transcription factor TRA-1 (Zarkower 2006). The activity of TRA-1 depends on the X-to-autosome (or X:A) ratio. In males, TRA-1 is inactive and leads to male fate and the production of sperm. In hermaphrodites, TRA-1 is active and leads to a female somatic fate and the formation of female gametes.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3911, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "43e2ddd5-132a-48b1-b895-8df4accc4c66": {"__data__": {"id_": "43e2ddd5-132a-48b1-b895-8df4accc4c66", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 12](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1fda165-26d7-4ca3-944b-3192037cb044", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 12](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "hash": "32c829aec0f4ddb2c0590a84fb03d6855a0cccdd7e6bd3d0fd94ddbae3acf61b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "28236655-a096-45ef-be44-fd5ad275829e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 12](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "hash": "7e616c06ea4a80bd61a5f6b00ab2baf58ee34b116f93768db0984f9997f54676", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "As with vulval development, the development of male tail structures and their associated muscles involves the coordinated action of multiple signaling pathways (Emmons 2005).

C. elegans also has a dosage compensation system that downregulates expression of genes on the X-chromosome in hermaphrodites to equalize X-linked expression between the sexes. A sex-specific dosage compensation complex, analogous to the chromatin condensin complex used in mitosis and meiosis, decorates the X chromosomes in hermaphrodites and downregulates X-linked genes by 50% to equal the gene expression from the single X chromosome in males (Meyer 2005).\n\n398 A.

As sequence information from additional Caenorhabditis species as well as more distantly-related nematodes has become available in the past decade, the information from C. elegans has provided the basis for rich comparative genomics studies (Coghlan 2005). The entire C. elegans genome is 100 Mb (C. elegans Sequencing Consortium 1998) and has 20,444 protein-coding genes (WormBase release WS245, October 2014). Both C. elegans sexes contain five autosomal chromosomes named linkage group (LG) I, II, III, IV, and V and the X chromosome. Individual genes of C. elegans are arranged in conventional eukaryotic fashion with 5' untranslated regions, open reading frames (ORFs) containing exons and introns, and 3' untranslated regions. Compared to vertebrate genes, C. elegans genes are relatively small with the average gene size of 3 kb due primarily to the presence of very small introns (Spieth and Lawson 2006; C. elegans genes also have many normal-sized introns). The chromosomes do not contain traditional centromeres; during mitosis the microtubule spindle attaches to more than one position along the chromosome (these attachments are said to be holocentric or polycentric). In fact, a specific sequence does not seem to be required for attachment since extrachromosomal DNA-containing transgenes can be inherited throughout many cell divisions.\n\nThe C. elegans genome has two unusual aspects: most protein-coding mRNAs are trans-spliced and some genes are organized in operons (Blumenthal 2005). Trans-splicing is the addition of one of two 22-nucleotide leader sequences (SL1 and SL2) at the 5' end of mRNA. The leader sequence is believed to aid in translational initiation and, because SL1/2 sequences are known, can be used experimentally to identify the sequence at the 5' end of mRNAs. Some C. elegans mRNAs are formed from multigenic transcripts with the first mRNA spliced to SL1 and subsequent mRNAs to SL2. The genes that code for these transcripts are closely spaced together in tandem and are transcribed under the control of a single promoter. These transcripts are similar to those produced by bacterial operons and code for gene products that are coexpressed (Blumenthal 2005). They differ, however, in that the processed transcripts in C. elegans generate multiple mRNAs. Past experiments have indicated that DNA is not methylated in C. elegans, but recent, higher resolution studies have suggested that some methylation does occur (Hu et al. 2015). Aspects of gene regulation such as transcription, translation, chromatin remodeling, and post-transcriptional modifications (ubiquitination, phosphorylation, histone methylation, and glycosylation) have all been studied using the genetic tools of C. elegans.\n\n# Caenorhabditis Ecology and Evolution\n\nIn the wild, C. elegans is primarily restricted to temperate regions. In contrast, related species such as C. briggsae are considered \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d since they are found in many habitats (Kiontke and Sudhaus 2006). Although often mischaracterized as a soil nematode, larval and adult C. elegans have been routinely recovered from organic-rich garden soils, compost, and rotting fruit and plant stems, and only rarely from \u201cwild\u201d soil (Blaxter and Denver 2012; F\u00e9lix and Duveau 2012). Compost-like locations are likely to be attractive to the animals because they are abundant in the bacterial food the animals need. Outside of rotting fruits and stems, C. elegans are usually found as dauer larvae, the dispersal form of the animal. Dauer larvae are unusual in that they engage in \u201cnictating\u201d behavior, wherein they stand on their tails and wave their heads in the air (Lee et al. 2011). This activity is thought to aid in attachment of the dauer larva to other invertebrate couriers, such as isopods, so the nematode can be dispersed from a depleted food source to a new food source (Croll and Matthews 1977).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4038, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53f8a634-d50d-427b-93e5-eab76091b91c": {"__data__": {"id_": "53f8a634-d50d-427b-93e5-eab76091b91c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 13](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f3173435-cf77-465b-a278-e88e9cdf390f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 13](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "hash": "c9ad0180ba29ded55b0f5db7b2a5185078d10e22e763ccc275d5ab643fb1a5d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3d7c38bb-3e17-4223-9faa-85f8a4c5a5e8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 13](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "hash": "2e6aea8491c539b2d41f1b6d1cefba6588c9735350b5c569170459cfac4a0bff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Compost-like locations are likely to be attractive to the animals because they are abundant in the bacterial food the animals need.

Plant parasitic nematodes cause significant crop damage (billions of dollars each year; Kandoth and Mitchum 2013) and animal parasites devastate domesticated animals (including heartworm in dogs and cats; McCall et al. 2008). C. elegans has played a critical role in elucidating the mode of action of anthelmintic drugs (Holden-Dye and Walker 2014). C. elegans may also prove useful in identifying new strategies to reduce or alleviate the action of parasitic nematodes, particularly since the emergence of resistance to current drugs (Holden-Dye and Walker 2014).\n\n# Brief History of C. elegans Research and Key Discoveries\n\nIn Brenner\u2019s original vision, detailed elucidation of the development and anatomy of C. elegans would serve as the foundation for the subsequent analysis of mutants. Both of these efforts were completed primarily at the LMB. The transparency of the animal allowed John Sulston, Robert Horvitz, Judith Kimble, David Hirsh, and Einhard Schierenberg to describe every cell division starting with the single-celled zygote and ending with the adult male and hermaphrodite (Sulston and Horvitz 1977; Kimble and Hirsh 1979; Sulston et al. 1980, 1983). These efforts produced the first and only entire cell lineage of any multicellular organism. During this time, John White, Sydney Brenner, Donna Albertson, Eileen Southgate, Sam Ward, and Nichol Thomson described the anatomy and connectivity of all 302 neurons of the adult hermaphrodite (Ward et al. 1975; Albertson and Thomson 1976; White et al. 1976, 1986). These projects set a standard for completeness in the understanding of the animal that has been a hallmark of C. elegans research. Such completeness was also seen in the sequencing of the C. elegans genome (C. elegans Genome Consortium 1998), the description of the wiring diagram of the adult male (Jarrell et al. 2012), and development of genome-wide feeding RNAi experiments (Fraser et al. 2000; Kamath et al. 2001).\n\nSydney Brenner, Robert Horvitz, and John Sulston were awarded the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in part for the significance of the lineage project as a platform for discovery of genes that orchestrated developmental decisions.\n\nSince work on C. elegans genetics began in earnest during the 1970s, this animal has proven fruitful for making general discoveries about cell and developmental biology (Table 2). These findings have helped us understand molecular genetic mechanisms in all animals. Evolution has maintained thousands of conserved genes that play similar, or in some cases nearly identical, functions in nematodes and other animals.\n\n400 A. K. Corsi, B. Wightman, and M.

For example, the vertebrate apoptosis regulator Bcl-2 can functionally substitute for its C. elegans ortholog ced-9 (Hengartner and Horvitz 1994). Thus, discoveries with direct relevance to understanding all animals were made possible by what initially appeared to be an ambitious and esoteric undertaking to define in detail the structure and genetics of an apparently simple animal.\n\nGenetic screens in C. elegans have yielded a number of first discoveries of genes and pathways that play important roles in all animals. These discoveries include key genes regulating apoptosis (programmed cell death) (Hedgecock et al. 1983; Ellis and Horvitz 1986), the Ras and Notch signaling pathways (Priess 2005; Greenwald and Kovall 2013; Sundaram 2013), synaptic function (Gengyo-Ando et al. 1993; Richmond et al. 1999), axon pathfinding (Hedgecock et al. 1987, 1990), longevity (Kenyon et al. 1993; Kimura et al. 1997), and developmental timing (the heterochronic genes) (Ambros and Horvitz 1984). The study of the heterochronic genes yielded the first small regulatory RNA, the microRNA (miRNA) product of the lin-4 gene (Lee et al. 1993). Robert Horvitz\u2019s 2002 Nobel Prize was awarded in part to recognize the broad significance of the genetic mechanisms of apoptosis, and Gary Ruvkun and Victor Ambros shared the 2008 Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research in recognition of the general importance of miRNA.\n\nC. elegans researchers also made important technical discoveries that were subsequently adapted and applied to other biological systems. For example, early gene-cloning efforts helped advance techniques for defining and assembling overlapping (contiguous) clones from animal genomes, which led to C. elegans being the first metazoan to have its entire genome sequenced in 1998 (C. elegans Genome Consortium 1998). Some of these strategies were also employed in early human genome sequencing efforts. Another discovery that led to a novel technique with broad biological impact was gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) (Fire et al. 1998). This powerful technique allows researchers working with many organisms to silence the expression of any gene and earned Andrew Fire and Craig Mello the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (Fire 2007; Mello 2007). Finally, the development of green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a biological marker (Chalfie et al. 1994) for which Marty Chalfie shared the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry grew directly from his interest in characterizing gene expression in live (and transparent) C. elegans. Now GFP and other fluorescent proteins are widely-used biological tools.\n\n# The C. elegans Community\n\nHaving mentioned all the biological reasons that C. elegans provides outstanding opportunities to study biological questions and all the achievements that past studies have accomplished, we would be remiss if we did not mention one other reason why the field has flourished: the community of C. elegans researchers. Our field has had a long tradition of openness and sharing of reagents and ideas. This openness was first encouraged by the publication of the C. elegans newsletter, The Worm Breeder\u2019s Gazette. The Gazette was started by Bob Edgar at the University of California, Santa Cruz so C. elegans researchers could tell each other about their research. Often work was described in the Gazette many months before it was officially published. For example, the first description of GFP as a biological marker (in the October 1993 issue of the Gazette) preceded the \u201cofficial\u201d publication by 5 months (Chalfie et al. 1994). The Gazette, now entirely online, is published as part of WormBook and is an excellent resource for new methods and helpful hints to aid C. elegans research.\n\nThe second person to greatly support and promote a community spirit among C. elegans researchers was John Sulston. When John began determining the physical map of the C. elegans genome with Alan Coulson, one of his goals was to promote sharing. He did this by not having any independent research of his own (taking away even a hint that he might be a competitor) and by providing a service whereby any researcher could get large amounts of DNA on either side of a cloned fragment or in the region of a mapped gene.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4344, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e16d7cd9-1c2a-40b7-8ea4-5044f2933ffa": {"__data__": {"id_": "e16d7cd9-1c2a-40b7-8ea4-5044f2933ffa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 16](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99bf515a-e71c-41ad-9f53-6c651dfc8c9f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 16](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "hash": "8fa7daac7542dc43466486b31c3e1970f0100fb7fd147e9aca18cb2854e8daa7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7350ba11-c623-46b4-b379-75f84b49ef2f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Corsi_et_al_2015, Section Page 16](https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/200/2/387/5936175)"}, "hash": "4bc05ef357139d17903668cc8b86f3a51b8213a417a36a45d3be141382d51b5c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "For example, the first description of GFP as a biological marker (in the October 1993 issue of the Gazette) preceded the \u201cofficial\u201d publication by 5 months (Chalfie et al. 1994).

He did this by not having any independent research of his own (taking away even a hint that he might be a competitor) and by providing a service whereby any researcher could get large amounts of DNA on either side of a cloned fragment or in the region of a mapped gene. As a result, researchers did not hoard their DNA before publication and investigators benefited by having clones of entire genes. The mapping project was able to link the physical (DNA) and genetic (recombination) maps. Consequently, several collaborations were initiated because scientists shared their data before publication (e.g., Savage et al. 1989; Miller et al. 1992). As the mapping project turned to the sequencing of the C. elegans genome, John made sure that the openness continued; results of the sequencing project were made available daily. This same approach was used when John and Alan along with Bob Waterston and many others turned to sequencing the human genome.\n\nA field with many thousands of researchers cannot be as closely associated as in the early days when virtually all researchers knew one another because they were Sydney Brenner\u2019s F1 and F2 progeny. Nonetheless, the C. elegans field continues to share resources and information. The many free online resources (Table 1), the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center, and the many large, community projects (e.g., ModEncode Project, National Bioresource Project for the Experimental Animal C. elegans, and C. elegans Gene Knockout Consortium) show that the sharing spirit continues. This spirit and the general enthusiasm of C. elegans researchers are also evident at the biennial C. elegans and the many alternate-year special topics and local meetings. C. elegans has also proven a useful system for undergraduate and even high school education. The field continues to grow and to share.\n\nLooking to the future, C. elegans will continue to be an important source of scientific discoveries. Many of the reasons for past successes will aid future research, especially the ability to look at individual cells within the context of the entire animal.

In addition, analysis of the ever-increasing collection of regulatory RNAs certainly will add to our understanding of the development and adaptability of *C. elegans. Continued use of optogenetics on larger and larger sets of neurons and the analysis of the functional expression of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and their receptors and of gap junction proteins is likely to produce the first integrated view of the working of a complete nervous system. Investigations using C. elegans promise to generate insights into new areas, such as host\u2013pathogen interactions, synthetic biology, and ecology. Finally, we are confident that new and unexpected discoveries made in C. elegans*, as they have done so often in the past, will change our views of how organisms develop, live, and age.

However, the neural mechanisms of monoaminergic orchestration of behavior are poorly understood. Touch elicits an escape response in Caenorhabditis elegans where the animal moves backward and turns to change its direction of locomotion. We show that the tyramine receptor SER-2 acts through a Gao pathway to inhibit neurotransmitter release from GABAergic motor neurons that synapse onto ventral body wall muscles. Extrasynaptic activation of SER-2 facilitates ventral body wall muscle contraction, contributing to the tight ventral turn that allows the animal to navigate away from a threatening stimulus. Tyramine temporally coordinates the different phases of the escape response through the synaptic activation of the fast-acting ionotropic receptor, LGC-55, and extrasynaptic activation of the slow-acting metabotropic receptor, SER-2. Our studies show, at the level of single cells, how a sensory input recruits the action of a monoamine to change neural circuit properties and orchestrate a compound motor sequence.\n\n# Citation\n\nDonnelly JL, Clark CM, Leifer AM, Pirri JK, Haburcak M, et al.

The release of neuromodulators can activate or refine basic motor patterns generated by fast-acting neurotransmitters in a neural network.\n\nIn mammals, monoamines such as serotonin, dopamine, and noradrenaline are associated with specific behavioral states. Adrenergic modulation provides one of the most striking examples of the coordination of behavior and physiology to reflect an internal state of stress. Adrenergic transmitters stimulate the amygdala and increase heart rate, muscle tone, oxygen supply to the brain, and the release of glucose from energy stores to prepare for a fight-or-flight response. Noradrenaline and adrenaline are not used by invertebrates, but the structurally related monoamines octopamine and tyramine are often considered as the invertebrate counterparts of these adrenergic transmitters. Octopamine and tyramine have been implicated in subordinate behavior in lobsters, the honey bee sting response, the energy metabolism of flight in locusts, aggression in crickets and fruit flies, and the escape response of C. elegans.\n\nPioneering studies in the locust, mollusks, and crustaceans have supported an \"orchestration hypothesis\" where monoamines control behavioral states through the recruitment of distinct neural circuits. However, the sensory input that triggers the release of monoamines and the molecular and neural coding of these behaviors remain poorly understood.\n\nThe C. elegans escape response consists of a behavioral sequence used by the animal to navigate away from a threatening stimulus. C. elegans moves on its side by propagating a sinusoidal wave of ventral-dorsal muscle contractions along the length of its body. Locomotion is normally accompanied by exploratory head movements in which the tip of the nose moves rapidly from side to side.

There are many examples where sequential motor patterns of specific behaviors have been described in great detail. However, the neural mechanisms that orchestrate a full behavioral sequence are poorly understood. Gentle touch to the head of the roundworm *C. elegans* elicits an escape response in which the animal quickly moves backward. The reversal is followed by a deep turn that allows the animal to change its direction of locomotion and move away from the threatening stimulus. We found that the neurotransmitter tyramine controls the initial reversal phase of the escape response through the activation of a fast-acting ion channel and the later turning phase through the activation of a slow-acting G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR). We show that this tyramine GPCR is expressed in neurons that make contacts with the ventral muscles of the animal. Activation of this receptor facilitates the contraction of ventral muscles and thus allows the animal to turn and resume locomotion in the opposite direction during its escape. Our studies show how a single neurotransmitter coordinates sequential phases of a complex behavior through the activation of distinct classes of receptors.\n\nThe response is usually followed by a deep ventral head bend, allowing the animal to make a sharp (omega) turn and change its direction of locomotion. The completion of the entire escape response takes approximately 10 s and requires sensory processing, decision-making, and sequential inhibition and activation of distinct motor programs. Therefore, the anterior touch response is a highly orchestrated motor sequence with complexity far beyond that of a simple reflex.\n\nThe neural wiring diagram in combination with genetic and laser ablation experiments has provided a framework for the neural circuit that controls the initial phase of the escape response [19\u201321]. *C. elegans has a single pair of tyraminergic motor neurons that are essential in coordinating the backing response with suppression of head movements [13]. Synaptic activation of the tyramine-gated chloride channel, LGC-55, inhibits forward locomotion and induces the relaxation of neck muscle [22]. The coordination of these motor programs increases the animals\u2019 chances of escaping from predacious fungi that use constricting rings to catch nematodes, illustrating the vital importance of monoaminergic motor control [23,24]. How this initial phase of the escape response is temporally linked to later stages in which the animal makes a sharp turn to navigate away from the stimulus is unknown. To elucidate how monoamines may orchestrate the activity of specific neural circuits in complex behaviors, we analyzed the role of tyramine in C. elegans* locomotion during the escape response. We show that the extrasynaptic activation of a G-protein coupled tyramine receptor generates asymmetry in a locomotion program, thus allowing the animal to execute a deep ventral turn and navigate away from the stimulus.\n\n# Results\n\n# ser-2 Mutants Are Resistant to Exogenous Tyramine\n\n*C. elegans* become immobilized on plates containing exogenous tyramine in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1A and Figure S1) [22]. Three GPCRs have been shown to bind tyramine with high affinity: TYRA-2, TYRA-3, and SER-2 [25\u201328]. To determine whether the effects of tyramine are mediated by these GPCRs, we examined the locomotion of ser-2(pk1357 and ok2103), tyra-2(tm1815), and tyra-3(ok325) deletion mutants on agar plates containing exogenous tyramine. Wild-type, tyra-2, and tyra-3 mutant animals become immobilized on 30 mM tyramine within 5 min (Figure S2). However, ser-2 mutant animals sustained movement on plates containing exogenous tyramine (Figure 1A\u2013C and Figure S1). Sensitivity to exogenous tyramine is restored back to wild-type levels in ser-2 mutants containing a ser-2 genomic transgene (Figure 1B,C and Figure S2). This indicates that exogenous tyramine mediates its paralytic effects through the hyperactivation of endogenous tyramine signaling pathways that are at least in part dependent on SER-2.\n\nWe have previously shown that activation of the tyramine-gated chloride channel, LGC-55, inhibits head movements and forward locomotion [22].

This indicates that exogenous tyramine mediates its paralytic effects through the hyperactivation of endogenous tyramine signaling pathways that are at least in part dependent on SER-2.\n\nWe have previously shown that activation of the tyramine-gated chloride channel, LGC-55, inhibits head movements and forward locomotion [22]. Exogenous tyramine initially induced backward locomotion and the inhibition of head movements in both the wild-type and ser-2 mutants. However, unlike the wild type, ser-2 mutants recovered and resumed forward locomotion and head movements within minutes. Body movements of lgc-55 mutants are inhibited, similar to the wild-type, but head movements are sustained on exogenous tyramine (Figure 1C,D). lgc-55; ser-2 double mutants largely persisted both head and body movements on exogenous tyramine, however locomotion remained slightly uncoordinated. This indicates that while the activation of the ionotropic LGC-55 and metabotropic SER-2 receptor are required for paralysis, exogenous tyramine may affect locomotion through the activation of other receptors.\n\nHead movements and body movements are controlled by distinct groups of muscles and motor neurons [13,20]. In wild-type animals the inhibition of head movements occurred rapidly (half time to immobilization, ti50 = 7762 s) and was followed by the slower inhibition of body movement (ti50 = 14963 s). This suggests that distinct signaling pathways contribute to tyramine\u2019s effects. The sustained body movements of ser-2 mutants on exogenous tyramine make it difficult to dissect the effects of exogenous tyramine on head movements. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of tyramine on head movements in an unc-3(e151) mutant background. unc-3 mutants display few body movements, but have normal head movements [29]. Head movements of ser-2 unc-3 double mutants were inhibited on exogenous tyramine, like those in the wild-type and unc-3 mutants (Figure 1D). Consistent with our previous observation [22], head movements were sustained in lgc-55: unc-3 double mutants. The kinetics and distinct inhibition of head and body movements of lgc-55 and ser-2 mutants indicates that exogenous tyramine induces the fast immobilization of head movements mainly through the hyperactivation of the ionotropic tyramine receptor LGC-55 followed by the immobilization of body movements through hyperactivation of the metabotropic tyramine receptor SER-2.\n\n# Gao Signaling Pathway Mutants Are Resistant to Exogenous Tyramine\n\nTo identify genes involved in tyramine signaling, we performed a genetic screen for mutants that are resistant to the immobilizing effects of exogenous tyramine on body movements. Four isolates from this screen, zf47, zf97, zf98, and zf133, sustained movement on plates containing 30 mM tyramine. Genetic mapping, complementation tests, and sequence analysis showed that zf47 was an allele of goa-1. goa-1 encodes the *C. elegans ortholog of the neural G protein-alpha subunit of the Gao class. GOA-1/Gao is expressed throughout the nervous system and is thought to negatively regulate synaptic transmission through the inhibition of EGL-30, the C. elegans Gaq ortholog [30\u201332]. We found that zf97, zf98, and zf133 were alleles of dgk-1, which encodes the C. elegans* ortholog of the vertebrate brain diacylglycerol kinase theta (DAGh) [32,33].", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3769, "end_char_idx": 7380, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69132b99-3715-41bb-ba5f-832c98d85321": {"__data__": {"id_": "69132b99-3715-41bb-ba5f-832c98d85321", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Donnelly_et_al_2013, Section Page 3](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001529)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "272b7470-d2a8-4657-bf14-1ee9157f51dd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Donnelly_et_al_2013, Section Page 3](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001529)"}, "hash": "116046b7011b83d23a0df9b735c152724eee6380918149a1642d22d01d10204b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "36d7a5f6-7a6e-42d4-8cc3-b1a7ae78640e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fb82030b1cbf470f8f0d14914a097a7a7ac27f36abcd81f0a67d5dc3ef69de54", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Monoaminergic Orchestration of a Complex Behavior\n\n|A|100|80|B|8|10080|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|SER-2|1|60|40|1|6040|\n|GOA-- GaDGK-DAGOEGL-30| | | | | |\n|Gaq|EAT-16,|RGS| | | |\n|20|88|#+*|88|wild type|ser-2(pk1357)|\n|2|1|1|1|8|8|\n|1|tyramine concentration (mM)|1020|30|40|50|\n|60|3|8|C|100| |\n|8|80|2|80|7|60|\n|40|7|6040|68|20| |\n|10|15|20| |5|10|\n|15|20| | | | |\n\nFigure 1. ser-2 mutants are partially resistant to the paralytic effects of exogenous tyramine.

Previously characterized null mutants for goa-1 and dgk-1 were also resistant to the paralytic effect of tyramine on both head and body movements (Figure 1B). We found that egl-30/Gaq gain-of-function mutants and mutants for eat-16, which encodes a Regulator of G-protein Signaling (RGS) protein that inhibits EGL-30 [35], are resistant to exogenous tyramine (Figure 1B). Unlike goa-1 and dgk-1 mutants, which exhibit hyperactive locomotion and egg-laying behavior, ser-2 mutants did not have obvious behavioral defects [36]. Therefore, mutations that reduce GOA-1/Gao signaling or increase EGL-30/Gaq confer resistance to exogenous tyramine. The resistance of ser-2 mutants to exogenous tyramine suggests that SER-2 signals through GOA-1/Gao to modulate locomotion.\n\nSER-2 Acts in GABAergic Neurons Where does SER-2 act to confer resistance to exogenous tyramine?", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3306, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36d7a5f6-7a6e-42d4-8cc3-b1a7ae78640e": {"__data__": {"id_": "36d7a5f6-7a6e-42d4-8cc3-b1a7ae78640e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Donnelly_et_al_2013, Section Page 3](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001529)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "272b7470-d2a8-4657-bf14-1ee9157f51dd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Donnelly_et_al_2013, Section Page 3](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001529)"}, "hash": "116046b7011b83d23a0df9b735c152724eee6380918149a1642d22d01d10204b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "69132b99-3715-41bb-ba5f-832c98d85321", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Donnelly_et_al_2013, Section Page 3](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001529)"}, "hash": "d47f0efb5e5a45e9959a0c29218f9bf3bb0c7e07e25f6216b9a29e3f9f13f15f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "We found that egl-30/Gaq gain-of-function mutants and mutants for eat-16, which encodes a Regulator of G-protein Signaling (RGS) protein that inhibits EGL-30 [35], are resistant to exogenous tyramine (Figure 1B).

A ser-2 genomic rescuing transgene restored sensitivity of ser-2 mutants to exogenous tyramine, indicating that the transgene is expressed in the cells that confer sensitivity to exogenous tyramine (Figure 1B and Figure S2). The ser-2 genomic locus is large and complex and encodes several splice variants [25,36]. To analyze the ser-2 expression pattern we expressed mCherry under the control of an 11.8 kb ser-2 promoter sequence that included the four alternative first exons. We found that our Pser-2::mCherry reporter was expressed in head muscles, as well as several neurons in the head and ventral cord. The ser-2 reporter was expressed in the first and second row of muscle cells, which are distinct from neck muscles (third and fourth row of muscle cells).\n\nPLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org\n\nApril 2013 | Volume 11 | Issue 4 | e1001529", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2601, "end_char_idx": 4153, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c8be6b7-5fc3-46e6-ba4c-f5cabe078239": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c8be6b7-5fc3-46e6-ba4c-f5cabe078239", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Donnelly_et_al_2013, Section Page 4](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001529)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e753c7c8-f2a1-4bca-8e7a-69c2fc16d797", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Donnelly_et_al_2013, Section Page 4](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001529)"}, "hash": "f2e0e9090f9de8d5965b84f7112f8082f8284a75d500481518001d608e1a3064", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fcd81bf4-238a-4a63-b7ac-7f10366bba21", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "43568bf8a94e5f1de97f63a5628b4027398c8be36216fc7ffb61b6ce6bfc8673", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "# Monoaminergic Orchestration of a Complex Behavior\n\nthat express the tyramine-gated chloride channel LGC-55 (Figure S3). lgc-55 mutants fail to suppress head movements in response to touch, but head movements were suppressed normally in ser-2 mutants, indicating that only LGC-55 is required for tyramine-induced head relaxation. The ser-2 reporter was not expressed in interneurons that control locomotion, as expression did not overlap with Pglr-1::GFP and Plgc-55::GFP reporters that are expressed in the locomotion command neurons (unpublished data). ser-2 reporter expression was also observed in 13 cells in the ventral cord (Figure 2A) that send commissures to the dorsal cord. The ventral cord is composed of excitatory cholinergic and inhibitory GABAergic motor neurons that innervate body wall muscles and control locomotion. Coexpression analysis with GFP reporters that specifically label cholinergic or GABAergic neurons showed that Pser-2::mCherry was highly expressed in a subset of GABAergic motor neurons (Figure 2B\u2013D). The same set of GABAergic motor neurons were labeled in transgenic line (Pser-2a::GFP) that expressed a reporter for the SER-2A isoform (unpublished data) [36]. GABAergic ventral nerve cord neurons are subdivided into 13 VD motor neurons that synapse onto the ventral body wall muscles, and 6 DD motor neurons that synapse onto the dorsal body wall muscles. The cells that highly express the ser-2 reporter do not co-label with a Pflp-13::GFP reporter, which is expressed in the DD motor neurons (unpublished data) [37]. This indicates SER-2 is specifically expressed in the GABAergic VD motor neurons.\n\nSince GABAergic motor neurons are required for normal locomotion, we tested if SER-2 acts in these cells to mediate the inhibitory effects of tyramine on movement. No other promoters have been described that specifically drive expression in the GABAergic VD neurons. The complexity and size of the ser-2 promoter did not allow us to define promoter elements that specifically drive expression in the VD neurons. We therefore expressed ser-2 cDNA in all GABAergic neurons using the unc-47 promoter (Punc-47::SER-2). ser-2 expression in GABAergic neurons of ser-2 mutants restored normal sensitivity to exogenous tyramine (Figure 2E).\n\nTo determine if GABA signaling affects tyramine sensitivity, we tested GABA-deficient mutants for sensitivity to exogenous tyramine. We found that unc-25 mutants, which lack glutamate decarboxylase required for GABA synthesis [38], were slightly hypersensitive to the immobilizing effects of exogenous tyramine (Figure 2E, Figure S4). This suggests that reduced GABA signaling increases the sensitivity to exogenous tyramine, likely through the hyperactivation of other tyramine receptors, such as LGC-55 and TYRA-2. GABA deficiency suppressed the resistance phenotype of ser-2 mutants, since unc-25; ser-2 double mutants were nearly as sensitive to tyramine as unc-25 single mutants (Figure 2E). These epistasis experiments indicate that SER-2 acts upstream or in parallel to GABAergic signaling and are consistent with the hypothesis that SER-2 acts in the VD neurons to inhibit GABA signaling and control locomotion.\n\nWe performed cell-specific rescue experiments to determine whether G-protein signaling components are required in the GABAergic neurons to mediate sensitivity to the exogenous tyramine. Expression of goa-1 or eat-16 in the GABAergic neurons (Punc-47::GOA-1/Gao and Punc-47::EAT-16/RGS) of goa-1 and eat-16 mutants, respectively, did not rescue the hyperactive locomotion phenotype. However, goa-1 expression in GABAergic neurons of goa-1 mutants largely restored sensitivity to exogenous tyramine (Figure 2E, Figure S4). Similarly, rescue expression of eat-16 in GABAergic neurons partly restores sensitivity to exogenous tyramine.

The activation of the Gaq pathway in other cells may contribute to tyramine resistance phenotype in G-protein signaling mutants since the sensitivity to tyramine is not completely restored to wild-type levels. Nonetheless, the increased sensitivity of GABA-neuron-specific rescue of G-protein signaling mutants suggest that exogenous tyramine induces body immobilization through the activation of SER-2A and a Gao pathway in GABAergic neurons.\n\n# SER-2 Inhibits Neurotransmitter Release\n\nTo test the hypothesis that SER-2 modulates neurotransmitter release from ventral cord motor neurons, we analyzed mutants for their sensitivity to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb. Aldicarb increases acetylcholine (ACh) concentration at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), causing muscle contraction and eventual paralysis. Mutants with impaired ACh release are resistant to aldicarb-induced paralysis [39]. egl-30/Gaq mutants are resistant to aldicarb, whereas goa-1 mutants are hypersensitive to aldicarb-induced paralysis, indicating that EGL-30/Gaq stimulates and GOA-1/Gao inhibits ACh release from motor neurons [31\u201333]. Since body wall muscles also receive inhibitory GABA inputs, hypersensitivity to aldicarb can also be caused by decrease in GABA release at the NMJ [40\u201342]. The time course of paralysis of ser-2 mutants induced by aldicarb was similar to the wild-type (Figure 3A). This may be due to the restricted expression of ser-2 in a subset of GABAergic neurons or insufficient endogenous tyramine signaling to modulate GABA release under regular assay conditions. We therefore generated transgenic lines that overexpressed ser-2 in all cholinergic motor neurons (Pacr-2::SER-2) or GABAergic (Punc-47::SER-2) motor neurons and analyzed the rate of aldicarb-induced paralysis. In the absence of exogenous tyramine, the time course of paralysis of transgenic animals that express SER-2 in cholinergic or GABAergic ventral nerve cord motor neurons was similar to the wild-type (Figure 3A). However, on plates that contained both aldicarb and tyramine, animals that overexpressed ser-2 in cholinergic neurons (Pacr-2::SER-2) were more resistant to the paralytic effects of aldicarb than the wild-type. Conversely, animals that overexpressed ser-2 in all GABAergic neurons (Punc-47::SER-2) were hypersensitive to paralysis on plates containing aldicarb and tyramine (Figure 3B). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that SER-2 couples to the GOA-1/Gaio pathway to inhibit neurotransmitter release.\n\n# Tyramine-Mediated Reduction in GABA Synaptic Release Requires SER-2\n\nThe GABAergic VD motor neurons that express ser-2 make synaptic contacts onto the ventral musculature (Figure 4A). Therefore, to directly evaluate whether tyramine modulates synaptic release of GABA from motor neurons, we measured the frequency of endogenous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSCs) in whole-cell recordings from ventral body wall muscle cells (Figure 3C\u2013H).

The amplitude of endogenous GABA IPSCs was not significantly different between +/+ animals and ser-2 mutants (+/+, 29.561.4 pA; ser-2, 31.963.9 pA) and was not significantly affected by tyramine exposure for either strain (+/+, 26.961.2 pA; ser-2, 30.764.4 pA), indicating that clustering and function of postsynaptic GABA receptors are normal in ser-2 mutants, and not affected by tyramine (Figure 3H). The basal IPSC frequency prior to tyramine exposure was also not changed significantly in ser-2 mutants (+/+, 13.261.2 Hz; ser-2, 12.562 Hz). However, the tyramine-mediated reduction in IPSC frequency we observed in +/+ animals was significantly attenuated in ser-2 mutant animals (ser-2, 17%64% reduction; +/+, 35%64% reduction) such that it was indistinguishable from that observed in our control recordings without tyramine (control (no tyramine), 13%66% reduction). After normalization, tyramine application reduced IPSC frequency by 25%65% in +/+ compared to 5%65% reduction in ser-2 mutants (Figure 3G). Taken together, our data show that tyramine inhibits GABA release onto ventral body wall muscles in a SER-2-dependent manner.\n\n# Ablation of Subsets of GABAergic Motor Neurons Induces a Navigational Bias\n\nC. elegans moves on its side by propagating a sinusoidal wave of ventral-dorsal flexures along the length of its body. GABAergic VD motor neurons synapse onto ventral muscles and receive synaptic inputs from DA/DB cholinergic motor neurons that synapse onto dorsal body wall muscles (Figure 4A) [46]. Conversely, GABAergic DD motor neurons synapse onto dorsal muscles and receive synaptic inputs from VA/VB cholinergic motor neurons that synapse onto ventral body wall muscles. This arrangement suggests that a body bend is generated by Ach-mediated muscle contraction on one side and GABA-mediated relaxation on the contralateral side. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that animals in which the VD and DD neurons are killed by laser ablation move with a reduced wave amplitude [46]. The Pser-2::GFP and Pflp-13::GFP fluorescent markers, which specifically label the 13 VD and 6 DD neurons, respectively, allowed us to further test the role of the VD and DD neurons in laser ablation experiments. Animals in which only the VD neurons were ablated still propagated a sinusoidal wave along the anterior\u2013posterior axis, but displayed deeper ventral than dorsal flexures (Movies S1 and S2). As a consequence VD ablated animals moved in ventrally directed circles (radius 2.2060.29 body lengths, n = 5, Figure 4B,C). Conversely, animals in which the DD neurons were ablated exhibited deeper dorsal than ventral flexures and moved in dorsally directed circles (radius 0.6160.11 body lengths, n = 10). GABA-deficient unc-25 mutants made shallow body bends, but showed no directional bias in their locomotion pattern.

To determine if acute activation or inhibition of a specific subclass of GABAergic neurons could induce turning behavior, we used optogenetic stimulation and inhibition. The complexity of the ser-2 promoter, which contains coding sequences and alternative start sites, did not allow us to highly express light-activated channels in the VD neurons. To test whether the differential activity of the VD and DD motor neurons can induce bending, we generated transgenic animals that co-expressed the light-activated cation channel Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) [47] and light-activated chloride pump Halorhodopsin (NpHR) [48] in the six GABAergic DD motor neurons that synapse onto the dorsal muscles (Pflp-13::ChR2; Pflp-13::NpHR). ChR2 is activated by blue light and depolarizes neurons, while NpHR is activated by green light and hyperpolarizes neurons. We found that blue light activation induced a deep ventral turn (Figure 5 and Movie S3). In contrast, green light inhibition induced a deep dorsal turn. This turning behavior was not observed in nontransgenic animals or in transgenic animals raised on plates without all-trans-retinal, the chromophore of ChR2 and NpHR. To quantify turning behavior we calculated a bending index as the fraction of animals that turned ventrally or dorsally in response to light exposure (Figure 5A). A bending index of zero indicates no directional bias, whereas a negative or positive fraction indicates a ventral or dorsal bias, respectively. The bending index of Pflp-13::ChR2/NpHR transgenic animals was 20.4560.04 with exposure to blue light and 0.4160.06 for animals with exposure to green light. The flp-13 promoter also drives expression in a small set of head neurons in addition to the DD neurons. To determine if the activation or inhibition of the DD neurons was sufficient to induce bending, we used an optogenetic illumination system capable of tracking and stimulating individual regions of a freely moving animal [49]. Targeted illumination of the animal\u2019s ventral nerve cord that harbors the DD neuronal cell bodies induced a tight ventral bend in response to blue light activation and a tight dorsal bend in response to green light inhibition (Figure 5B and Movie S3). Switching between blue and green light exposure enabled the remote control of ventral and dorsal turning behavior in freely moving Pflp-13::ChR2/NpHR transgenic animals. Thus, the acute stimulation of GABA release on the dorsal side induced relaxation of the dorsal muscles resulting in a ventral turn. Conversely, the acute inhibition of GABA release onto the dorsal muscles resulted in hypercontraction of dorsal muscles and a dorsal bend. Our data indicate that modulating the activity of subsets of GABAergic neurons synapsing onto either the dorsal (DD) or ventral side (VD) of the animal can induce navigational bias.\n\n# ser-2 Facilitates the Execution of Omega Turns in the Escape Response\n\nThe expression of ser-2 in the GABAergic VD neurons suggested a possible role in C. elegans navigation. However, ser-2 mutants moved normally and did not display a ventral or dorsal directional bias (Figure 4B) possibly through a lack of basal tyramine to activate SER-2 during regular locomotion. We have previously shown that tyramine coordinates the timing of backing locomotion and the suppression of head movements in the escape response [13]. Gentle anterior touch triggers tyramine release from the RIM neurons and the synaptic activation of the tyramine-gated chloride channel, LGC-55 [22].

Animals with ablated GABAergic VD neurons did not have a defect in the execution of closed omega turns. The initiation of the omega turn may be triggered by the RIV head motorneurons that innervate ventral neck muscles [51]. The failure of DD ablated animals to fully close their omega turns indicates that the propagation of a sharp bend along the body requires the hypercontraction of ventral muscles and relaxation of dorsal muscles.\n\nTyramine-deficient tdc-1 mutants or RIM ablated fail to suppress head movements, make short reversals, and less frequently engage in the execution of omega turns [13,51]. In contrast, in response to anterior touch, ser-2 mutants suppressed head movements and reversed similar to wild-type animals (Figure S6). Furthermore, ser-2 mutants initiated an omega turn with a steep ventral head bend at the same frequency as the wild-type (Figure 6A). However, once ser-2 mutants initiated the omega turn, the ventral turn was less deep than the wild-type. Whereas most wild-type animals\u2019 heads touched the ventral side of the body (86%63.6%, n = 51) during an omega turn, ser-2 mutant animals failed to fully close the omega turn (27%67.8%, n = 62) (Figure 6B,C and Movies S4 and S5). Like the ser-2 mutants, tdc-1 mutants that are unable to synthesize tyramine and octopamine [13] failed to fully close the omega turn during the escape response (tdc-1 32%65.5%, n = 144). In contrast, tbh-1 mutants, which only lack octopamine, executed closed omega turns (tbh-1 72%67.9%, n = 153), comparable to the wild-type. We measured the angle of the omega turn (omega angle) from the deepest most contracted region of the body to the closest or touching points in the head and tail (Figure 6B,D). Wild-type animals typically fully closed their omega bend, while ser-2 mutants often failed to close omega bends, averaging an omega angle of 24u62.3u (n = 62). Animals lacking tyramine and octopamine (tdc-1) averaged an omega angle of 25u63.6u, while animals lacking octopamine (tbh-1) alone closed their omega turn. Since touch stimuli in these assays have some inherent variability, we also induced reversals by optogenetic activation of the touch sensory neurons. Light induces an escape response in Pmec-4::ChR2 transgenic animals that express the ChR2 in the touch sensory neurons [47,49,53]. We analyzed omega turns of Pmec-4::ChR2 transgenic animals in response to blue light in both wild-type and ser-2 mutant backgrounds. The light-induced escape response of ser-2 mutants showed a similar defect in omega turns as with reversals induced by touch and had a lower frequency of closed omega turns than the wild-type (Figure 6C,D). The turning defects of ser-2 mutants caused an alteration in the direction of reinitiated forward movement, or escape angle. In response to touch, wild-type animals and tbh-1 mutants completely reversed their direction of locomotion with an escape angle of 179u65u (n = 42) and 177u611u (n = 16), respectively. In contrast, in response to touch, ser-2 mutants and tdc-1 mutants made a more shallow escape angle, changing their direction from the point of stimulus by 150u65u (n = 46) and 143u66u (n = 35) (Figure 6E,F). Genomic rescue lines partially restore the omega angle defect of the mutants and restored the escape angle to wild-type levels.

However, understanding how sensory inputs recruit the action of monoamines and how changes in circuit properties affect behavior remains a tremendous challenge in the mammalian and even insect nervous systems. Tyramine release from a single pair of neurons, acting on few tyramine receptors in the C. elegans nervous system with single-cell resolution, provides unique insights into how monoamines orchestrate independent motor programs in a complex behavior. In this study we analyzed how the G-protein coupled receptor SER-2 modulates the output of a neural circuit in a compound motor sequence.\n\n# Tyramine Inhibits GABA Release\n\nOur genetic data suggest that the tyramine receptor SER-2 acts in a Gao neurons where it antagonizes Gaq /EGL-30 function in(GOA-1) pathway. The Gao/GOA-1 is expressed in all C. elegans many behaviors including locomotion, egg laying, and pharyngeal pumping [54,55]. Dopaminergic and serotonergic G-protein coupled receptors are expressed in C. elegans ventral cord neurons and their hyperactivation with exogenous dopamine or serotonin can induce paralysis within minutes [56\u201359]. However, ser-2 and other individual biogenic amine receptor mutants have no obvious locomotion defects. This indicates that Gao/GOA-1 and Gaq /EGL-30 integrate monaminergic signals to modulate neurotransmitter release from the motor neurons to control locomotion (Figure 1B). Dopamine, serotonin, and tyramine may allow the animal to refine locomotory patterns during different behavioral states. Gao/GOA-1 activity is thought to reduce the abundance of the synaptic priming protein UNC-13 at the synapse in C. elegans ventral cord neurons [33]. Our data indicate that tyramine reduces GABA release from VD motor neurons in a SER-2-dependent manner to augment the reorientation component of the escape response. In this regard, SER-2 shares similarities with mammalian alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors that inhibit neurotransmitter release and cause vasoconstriction during a fight-or-flight response [4].\n\n# Tyramine Acts Through Synaptic Activation of Ionotropic Receptors and Extrasynaptic Activation of Metabotropic Receptors\n\nTyramine can act as a classical neurotransmitter in C. elegans through the synaptic activation of the tyramine-gated chloride channel, LGC-55 [22,60]. While LGC-55 is predominantly expressed in cells that are directly synaptic to tyraminergic RIM neurons, SER-2-expressing cells do not receive direct RIM innervation, indicating that SER-2 activation occurs extrasynaptically [28,36]. In addition, ionotropic and metabotropic receptors have distinct ligand affinity and signaling kinetics. Ligand-gated ion channels like LGC-55 have a relatively low affinity for their ligand (Kd 0.1 to 1 mM) and affect postsynaptic potentials within milliseconds. This allows for fast localized signaling between neurons and their postsynaptic partners. In contrast, G-protein coupled receptors have a high affinity for their ligand (Kd 0.1\u20131 mM) and operate on timescales from seconds to minutes [61]. Synaptic spillover from the synaptic cleft and diffusion can activate these high affinity receptors that are distant from the release site. As tyramine is released from a single pair of head neurons that extend processes into the nerve ring, the activation of SER-2 in the GABAergic VD neurons depends upon the diffusion of tyramine through the pseudocoelomic space to reach the VD processes along the length of the body.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3192, "end_char_idx": 7327, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8aef0d61-f5d3-474f-812a-b956d3420836": {"__data__": {"id_": "8aef0d61-f5d3-474f-812a-b956d3420836", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Donnelly_et_al_2013, Section Page 12](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001529)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7b8bf125-20ae-45fa-b2b6-cd179b226ea2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Donnelly_et_al_2013, Section Page 12](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001529)"}, "hash": "5202b7fc1fe0e4bd885da662ad1ef650ad85146d43bd51447ddcdc1fd4f010f6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "35e7cb94-536a-4e1c-830a-668c2549e7a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Donnelly_et_al_2013, Section Page 12](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001529)"}, "hash": "0f007941ebc7806f56d3c472c6d40403fb696ebeb17d7ca85f500ff9d3271b6e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Ligand-gated ion channels like LGC-55 have a relatively low affinity for their ligand (Kd 0.1 to 1 mM) and affect postsynaptic potentials within milliseconds.

Furthermore, no tyramine or octopamine reuptake transporter has been identified in either *C. elegans or Drosophila, which suggests that tyramine diffusion from the synaptic cleft is part of its mechanism of action. Serotonin, dopamine, and octopamine receptors are also expressed in many C. elegans* cells that are not directly postsynaptic to the small number of monoaminergic neurons that release them [36,58]. Similarly, in humans the monoaminergic cells are grouped in relative small nuclei that can affect large areas of the CNS or the periphery that do not receive direct synaptic inputs. Thus, monoamines are not confined to the anatomical connectome and can reconfigure outputs to large neuronal ensembles [63].\n\n# Tyramine Temporally Coordinates Independent Motor Programs in a Complex Behavior\n\nThe translation of sensory input into goal-directed behaviors requires the temporal coordination of independent motor programs. In response to gentle touch to the head, *C. elegans engages in a compound motor sequence that allows the animal to retreat and navigate away from a touch stimulus (Figure 7A). In the base state, (I) forward locomotion is accompanied by exploratory head movements in which the tip of the nose moves from side to side. Gentle touch to the head of C. elegans* elicits an escape response where the animal reverses its direction of locomotion while suppressing its exploratory head movements (II). Classic laser ablation experiments by Chalfie et al. (1985) [19] complemented by the known neural wiring diagram support a model in which the touch sensory neurons (ALM/AVM) inhibit the forward locomotion \u201ccommand\u201d neurons (PVC/AVB) and activate the backward locomotion \u201ccommand\u201d neurons (AVD/AVA), causing the animal to move backward away from the stimulus (Figure 7B). The AVA backward locomotion \u201ccommand\u201d neurons activate the electrically coupled tyraminergic RIM motor neurons, which exhibit coactivated calcium transients with the AVA [64,65]. Tyramine release from the RIM induces the suppression of head movements through the activation of the fast-acting inhibitory chloride channel, LGC-55, in neck muscles and cholinergic motor neurons that control head movements [13,22]. Activation of LGC-55 in the AVB forward locomotion \u201ccommand\u201d neurons further inhibits forward locomotion, stimulating long reversals that are coupled to the initiation of an omega turn [50,51]. The reversal is followed by a deep ventral head bend (III), allowing the animal to make a sharp (omega) turn (IV) where the head of the animal slides along the ventral side of the body and resumes forward locomotion (I). Our data show that extrasynaptic activation of the G-protein coupled tyramine receptor SER-2 contributes to the proper execution of the omega turn during the last stage of the escape response. The RIV and SMD head motor neurons have been implicated in the ventral head bend that initiates the omega turn [51]. ser-2 mutants properly initiate the turn but bend less deep and the head often fails to touch the tail during the omega turn (IV).\n\n*C. elegans* locomotion is controlled by cholinergic (A and B) and GABAergic (D) motor neurons that propel a wave of ventral-dorsal muscle flexures along the length of the body. We show that SER-2 inhibits neurotransmitter release from the GABAergic VD neurons. VD motor neurons release GABA on ventral body wall muscles and receive inputs from cholinergic DB neurons that synapse onto dorsal muscles. The DD motor neurons receive input from cholinergic VB motor neurons and release GABA on dorsal body wall muscles (Figure 4A) [20]. This organization indicates that GABAergic motor neurons are essential for contralateral muscle relaxation, thus promoting local bending during wave propagation [46].\n\nWhile spatial orientation in response to sensory stimuli is a fundamental component of animal behavior, the neural correlates are poorly understood. To change its direction of movement and navigate its environment, an animal needs to generate asymmetry in its locomotion pattern [66,67].

Conversely, ablation of GABAergic DD neurons induces dorsally directed movement. Our experiments provide functional evidence that VD and DD neurons inhibit ventral and dorsal bending. Strikingly, the acute inhibition or activation of the DD motor neurons induces a sharp dorsal or ventral turn, respectively. Optogenetic neuronal stimulation can elicit distinct motor responses in multiple systems [47,68\u201370]. The optogenetic control of a single class of GABAergic neurons induces bi-directional steering and the remote control of animal navigation.\n\nThe ventral omega turn in the escape response occurs several seconds after the touch-induced reversal, which is within the time scale that GPCRs modulate neuronal activity. To make a tight turn the animal needs to generate an asymmetry in the excitation and inhibition of the ventral and dorsal muscle quadrants. Our data indicate that SER-2-mediated inhibition of GABAergic release onto the ventral muscles stimulates ventral muscle contraction and the proper propagation of the ventral body bend during the omega turn (Figure 7B). The kinetics of synaptic activation of the ion channel LGC-55 and extrasynaptic activation of the G-protein coupled receptor SER-2 temporally coordinates different phases of the escape response. Interestingly, the tyramine GPCR TYRA-3 modulates responses to pain-like stimuli and decision making [27,62]. This indicates that tyramine, much like the mammalian adrenergic signaling, coordinates different aspects of a flight response.\n\nOur results provide molecular and neural insights on how monoamines reconfigure the output of neural circuits and orchestrate complex behaviors. Many neurotransmitters, including serotonin, GABA, acetylcholine, and glutamate, act through both ion channels and GPCRs in animals ranging from worms to man. We hypothesize that the temporally coordinated activation of ionotropic and metabotropic receptors may be a common signaling motif employed across organisms to orchestrate behavioral responses. Furthermore, the different monoamines appear to play a strikingly conserved role in the specification of distinct internal states, suggesting that the principles of neuronal modulation are conserved across species.\n\n# Materials and Methods\n\nAll *C. elegans strains were grown at room temperature (22\u00b0C) on nematode growth media (NGM) agar plates with OP50 E. coli* as a food source [71].

Extrachromosomal arrays were integrated by X-ray irradiation (120 kV) and resulting transgenic strains were outcrossed at least four times to N2. A Pser-2::SER-2::GFP rescue construct was made by cloning 10.2 kb of genomic sequence including 2.2 kb upstream of the first translational start site into the pPD95.70 vector. The genomic rescue constructs used for exogenous tyramine and omega turn assays were injected between 10 and 20 ng/ml. A Pser-2::mCherry mini-gene reporter was constructed by cloning an 11.8 kb sequence that included the three start sites, first intron, and part of exon 2 into the pDM1247 vector. The GABAergic and cholinergic cell-specific rescue lines were cloned using ser-2a cDNA behind the unc-47 (1.2 kb) [72] and acr-2 (3.4 kb) promoters, respectively [73].\n\nA Pmec-4::ChR2::YFP plasmid [47] was injected at 80 ng/ml. The integrated strain was crossed into two ser-2 mutant allele backgrounds. Pflp-13::ChR2::GFP; Pflp-13::NpHR::CFP was cloned by inserting a 2 kb promoter from Pflp-13::GFP [37] into ChR2 and NpHR vectors [47,48].

Locomotion assays were performed on agar plates containing 2 mM acetic acid with or without tyramine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich). Approximately 10 animals were transferred to assay plates and scored for locomotion every minute over a 20-minute period. Animals were scored as immobilized if there was no sustained forward or backward locomotion in a 5-s interval. Aldicarb drug assays were performed using NGM agar plates supplemented with 0.5 mM aldicarb (Sigma-Aldrich) with or without 30 mM tyramine. Locomotion is not obviously affected on plates with 30 mM tyramine dissolved in NGM agar instead of the agar used in exogenous tyramine paralysis assays. Animals were scored as paralyzed when they did not move when prodded with a platinum wire.\n\nOptogenetic blue and green light-induced bending assays were performed with Pflp-13::ChR2::GFP; Pflp-13::NpHR::CFP; lite-1(ce314) transgenic animals. Bending behavior movies, worm tracking traces, and kymographs were generated using the CoLBeRT worm tracking system as previously described [49]. Animals were placed in between two glass slides in 200 ml of NGM containing 30% dextran. The space between the slides was approximately 0.127 mm and limited locomotion to two dimensions. The ventral nerve cord was illuminated with blue or green light using the micromirror control of the CoLBeRT system, and the behavior was analyzed using custom tracking software written in MATLAB. For assays used to calculate a bending index, young adult animals were transferred to NGM plates without food for 45 min. Food deprivation stimulated long forward runs, which facilitated the analysis of light-induced bending. Animals were exposed to blue or green light, using GFP (525 nm) and Rhodamine (550 nm) filters for 3 s. A dorsal or ventral bend were scored if the bend was larger than 45u. The bending index was calculated as the fraction of dorsally bending worms minus the fraction of ventrally bending worms. A positive fraction indicates a dorsal bias, a negative fraction indicates a ventral bias, and a zero value represents no directional bias or no response to light exposures.\n\nOmega turns were analyzed on NGM agar plates 2 d postpouring to control for assay plate humidity. Assay plates (60 mm diameter) were seeded with 40 ml OP50 E. coli and grown overnight at 37uC to produce a thin bacterial lawn. Young adult worms were transferred to an omega assay plate and allowed to acclimate for at least 10 min. Omega turns were induced by gentle anterior touch with fine eyebrow hair while recording using a FireWire camera and Astro IIDC software. For Pmec-4::ChR2::YFP-induced omega turns, animals were exposed to blue light for 5 s to induce a reversal. Bending angles and locomotion trajectories were calculated using Image J software analysis of movie stills. An omega turn was classified as a sharp turn larger than 90u from the initial trajectory, following a reversal of three or more body bends. The omega angle was measured using the deepest part of the bend as the apex with vectors extending to the closest points along the body. Angles larger than 60u were not scored. The escape angle was measured as the angle between the reversal trajectory and the trajectory of reinitiation of forward locomotion after the omega turn.\n\n# Laser Ablations\n\nAnimals were mounted on agar pads and anesthetized with 20 mM sodium azide.

A longitudinal incision was made by sharp glass electrode tip in the dorsolateral area, the intestine and gonad were removed, and the cuticle flap along the incision was glued down in order to expose the ventral medial body wall muscles along the ventral nerve cord. The preparation was then washed briefly for ,20 s with a solution of collagenase type IV from *Clostridium hystolyticum* (Sigma-Aldrich) in extracellular bath solution (at a concentration of 1 mg/ml) in order to remove the basement membrane overlying the muscles.\n\nThe extracellular solution consisted of 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, 15 mM HEPES, and 10 mM glucose (pH 7.4, osmolarity adjusted with 20 mM sucrose). The intracellular fluid (ICF) consisted of 25 mM K-gluconate, 115 mM KCl, 0.1 mM CaCl2, 50 mM HEPES, 5 mM Mg-ATP, 0.5 mM Na-GTP, 0.5 mM cGMP, 0.5 mM cAMP, and 1 mM BAPTA (pH 7.4, osmolarity adjusted with 10 mM sucrose). Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings from *C. elegans* body wall muscle cells (group of ventral medial muscles 9, 11, 13) from +/+ and ser-2 mutant strains were performed as previously described [43] using an EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA). Data acquisition and voltage protocols were controlled by HEKA Patchmaster software. Patch-clamp electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass with filament (Sutter Instrument), fire-polished to a resistance of 4\u20136 MV, and filled with an internal solution. 1 M KCl electrode with agarose bridge served as reference electrode. Leak currents and liquid junction potentials were not compensated, though pipette offset was zeroed immediately before getting a gigaohm seal. The membrane potential was clamped at 260 mV. Data were digitized at 6.67 kHz and low pass filtered at 3.3 kHz. Membrane capacitance and the series resistance (at least 20%, up to 60%) were compensated, and only recordings in which the series resistance was stable throughout the course of the recording were included. Endogenous synaptic activity data were collected in continuous mode (saved as 30-s recording sweeps). Typically, 60\u201390 s of control endogenous activity was recorded followed by a 90-s bath tyramine application (100 mM), and subsequent tyramine wash-out (occasional). The muscle preparation was continuously perfused by extracellular solution with or without tyramine by gravity-flow at a perfusion rate of 2 ml/min. Cells were excluded from analysis if a leak current .300 pA was observed. Only recordings with series resistance R,15 MV were included in the analysis. Data analysis and graphing were performed using Excel (Microsoft), Igor Pro (WaveMetrics Inc.), and GraphPrism (GraphPad Software). Mini Analysis software (Synaptosoft Inc.) was used to detect and analyze the endogenous events off-line. Parameters for detection of events were set as follows: amplitude threshold 12 pA, period to search local minimum 80 ms, time before a peak for baseline 20 ms, period to search a decay time 30 ms, fraction of peak to find a decay time 0.37, period to average a baseline 10 ms, area threshold 10, and number of points to average for peak 3.

(A) Wild-type animals become immobilized within 5 min on 30 mM tyramine (also see Pirri et al., 2009 [22]). (B) ser-2 mutants are resistant to body immobilization compared to wild-type, but become immobilized by 60 mM tyramine. Each data point represents the mean \u00b1 SEM for at least four trials totaling a minimum of 40 animals. (TIF)\n\n# Figure S2\n\ntyra-2 and tyra-3 mutant animals paralyze on exogenous tyramine. (A) tyra-2 and tyra-3 mutants become immobilized on plates containing 30 mM exogenous tyramine similar to wild-type. (B) Two additional SER-2 rescue strains (10 ng/ml injection) also rescue the immobilization resistance phenotype of ser-2 mutants. Rescue denotes the transgenic line Pser-2::SER-2; ser-2(pk1357). Each data point represents the mean \u00b1 SEM for at least five trials totaling a minimum of 50 animals. (TIF)\n\n# Figure S3\n\nPser-2::GFP and Plgc-55::mCherry are expressed in different cells.

Head muscle expression of Pser-2::GFP does not overlap with neck muscle expression of Plcg-55::mCherry. Unlike lgc-55 mutants, ser-2 mutants do suppress head movements in response to touch. ser-2 mutants occasionally reinitiate head movements before the reinitiation of forward locomotion (unpublished observation), which may suggest a role for ser-2 in head muscles.

(A) Shown is the percentage of animals that display sustained locomotion on 30 mM exogenous tyramine (see also Figure 2E). unc-25 (GABA deficient) mutants and unc-25; ser-2(pk1357) double mutants are not resistant to the paralytic effects of exogenous tyramine. Expression of SER-2 in all GABAergic neurons (Punc-47::SER-2) restores sensitivity of ser-2 mutants to exogenous tyramine. (B) Expression of GOA-1/Gao Punc-47::EAT-16) partial-GABAergic neurons (Punc-47::GOA-1 or EAT-16/RGS in all ly restores sensitivity to exogenous tyramine in the respective goa-1 and eat-16 mutants.

Here, to better understand the relationship between the structure and the function of a nervous system, we systematically measure signal propagation in 23,433 pairs of neurons across the head of the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans* by direct optogenetic activation and simultaneous whole-brain calcium imaging. We measure the sign (excitatory or inhibitory), strength, temporal properties and causal direction of signal propagation between these neurons to create a functional atlas. We find that signal propagation differs from model predictions that are based on anatomy. Using mutants, we show that extrasynaptic signalling not visible from anatomy contributes to this difference. We identify many instances of dense-core-vesicle-dependent signalling, including on timescales of less than a second, that evoke acute calcium transients\u2014often where no direct wired connection exists but where relevant neuropeptides and receptors are expressed. We propose that, in such cases, extrasynaptically released neuropeptides serve a similar function to that of classical neurotransmitters. Finally, our measured signal propagation atlas better predicts the neural dynamics of spontaneous activity than do models based on anatomy. We conclude that both synaptic and extrasynaptic signalling drive neural dynamics on short timescales, and that measurements of evoked signal propagation are crucial for interpreting neural function.\n\nBrain connectivity mapping is motivated by the claim that \"nothing defines the function of a neuron more faithfully than the nature of its inputs and outputs\"2. This approach to revealing neural function drives large-scale efforts to generate connectomes\u2014anatomical maps of the synaptic contacts of the brain\u2014in a diverse set of organisms, ranging from mice3 to *Platynereis*4. The *C. elegans* connectome1,5,6 is the most mature of these efforts, and has been used to reveal circuit-level mechanisms of sensorimotor processing7,8, to constrain models of neural dynamics9 and to make predictions of neural function10.\n\nAnatomy, however, omits key aspects of neurons' inputs and outputs, or leaves them ambiguous: the strength and sign (excitatory or inhibitory) of a neural connection are not always evident from wiring or gene expression. Many mammalian neurons release both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, and functional measurements are thus required to disambiguate their connections11. For example, starburst amacrine cells release both GABA (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid) and acetylcholine12; neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus release both serotonin and glutamate13; and neurons in the ventral tegmental area release two or more of dopamine, GABA and glutamate14. The timescale of neural signalling is also ambiguous from anatomy. In addition, anatomy disregards changes to neural connections from plasticity or neuromodulation; for example, in the head compass circuit in *Drosophila*15 or in the crab stomatogastric ganglion16, respectively. Both mechanisms serve to strengthen or to select subsets of neural connections out of a menu of possible latent circuits. Finally, anatomy ignores neural signalling that occurs outside the synapse, as explored here. These ambiguities or omissions all pose challenges for revealing neural function from anatomy.\n\nA more direct way to probe neural function is to measure signal propagation by perturbing neural activity and measuring the responses of other neurons. Measuring signal propagation captures the strength and sign of neural connections reflecting plasticity, neuromodulation and even extrasynaptic signalling. Moreover, direct measures of signal propagation allow us to define mathematical relations that describe how the activity of an upstream neuron drives activity in a downstream neuron, including its temporal response profile. Historically, this and related perturbative approaches have been called many names (Supplementary Information), but they all stand in contrast to correlative approaches that seek to infer neural function from activity correlations alone.

To overcome the challenges associated with spectral overlap between the actuator and the indicator, we used TWISP\u2014 a transgenic worm for interrogating signal propagation23, which expresses a purple-light actuator, GUR-3/PRDX-2 (refs. 24,25) and a nuclear-localized calcium indicator GCaMP6s (ref. 26) in each neuron (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 2b), along with fluorophores for neural identification from NeuroPAL (ref. 27) (Fig. 1c). Validation of the GUR-3/ PRDX-2 system is discussed in the Supplementary Information (see also Extended Data Fig. 2h and Supplementary Video 1). A drug-inducible gene-expression system was used to avoid toxicity during development, resulting in animals that were viable but still significantly less active than WT animals23 (see Methods). A stimulus duration of 0.3 s or 0.5 s was chosen to evoke modest calcium responses (Extended Data Fig. 2f), similar in amplitude to those evoked naturally by odour stimuli28.\n\nMany neurons exhibited calcium activity in response to the activation of one or more other neurons (Fig. 1d). A downstream neuron's response to a stimulated neuron is evidence that a signal propagated from the stimulated neuron to the downstream neuron.\n\nWe highlight three examples from the motor circuit (Fig. 1e\u2013g). Stimulation of the interneuron AVJR evoked activity in AVDR (Fig. 1e). AVJ had been predicted to coordinate locomotion after egg-laying by promoting forward movements29. The activity of AVD is associated with sensory-evoked (but not spontaneous) backward locomotion7,8,30,31, and AVD receives chemical and electrical synaptic input from AVJ1,6. Therefore, both wiring and our functional measurements suggest that AVJ has a role in coordinating backward locomotion, in addition to its previously described roles in egg-laying and forward locomotion.\n\nActivation of the premotor interneuron AVER evoked activity transients in AVAR (Fig. 1f). Both AVA31\u201335 (Extended Data Fig. 2h) and AVE31,36 are implicated in backward movement. Their activities are correlated31, and AVE makes gap-junction and many chemical synaptic contacts with AVA1,6.\n\nActivation of the turning-associated neuron SAADL36 inhibited the activity of the sensory neuron OLLR. SAAD had been predicted to inhibit OLL, on the basis of gene-expression measurements37. SAAD is cholinergic and it makes chemical synapses to OLL, which expresses an acetylcholine-gated chloride channel, LGC-47 (refs. 6,38,39). Other examples consistent with the literature are reported in Extended Data Table 1.\n\n## Signal propagation map\n\nWe generated a signal propagation map by aggregating downstream responses to stimulation from 113 C. elegans individuals (Fig. 2a). We report the mean calcium response in a 30-s time window \u0394F/F0t, averaged across trials and animals (Extended Data Fig. 3a). We imaged activity in response to stimulation for 23,433 pairs of neurons (66% of all possible pairs in the head). Measured pairs were imaged at least once, and some as many as 59 times (Extended Data Figs. 3b and 4a).

A total of 1,310 of the 23,433 measured neuron pairs, or 6%, pass our stringent criteria to be deemed functionally connected at q < 0.05 (Fig. 2c). Neuron pairs that are deemed functionally non-connected are reported in Extended Data Fig. 5b. Note that, in all cases, functional connections refer to 'effective connections' because they represent the propagation of signals over all paths in the network between the stimulated and the responding neuron, not just the direct (monosynaptic) connections between them.\n\nC. elegans neuron subtypes typically consist of two bilaterally symmetric neurons, often connected by gap junctions, that have similar wiring1 and gene expression38, and correlated activity41. As expected, bilaterally symmetric neurons are (eight times) more likely to be functionally connected than are pairs of neurons chosen at random (Fig. 2c).\n\nThe balance of excitation and inhibition is important for a network's stability42,43 but has not to our knowledge been previously measured in the worm. Our measurements indicate that 11% of q < 0.05 functional connections are inhibitory (Fig. 2d), comparable to previous estimates of around 20% of synaptic contacts in C. elegans37 or around 20% of cells in the mammalian cortex44. Our estimate is likely to be a lower bound, because we assume that we only observe inhibition in neurons that already have tonic activity.\n\nAs expected from anatomy, neuron pairs that had direct (monosynaptic) wired connections were more likely to be functionally connected than were neurons with only indirect or multi-hop anatomical connections. Similarly, the likelihood of functional connections decreased as the minimal path length through the anatomical network increased (Fig. 2e). Conversely, neurons that had large minimal path lengths through the anatomical network were more likely to be functionally non-connected than were neurons that had a single-hop minimal path length (Fig. 2g). We investigated how far responses to neural stimulation penetrate into the anatomical network. Functionally connected (q < 0.05) neurons were on average connected by a minimal anatomical path length of 2.1 hops (Fig. 2f), suggesting that neural signals often propagate multiple hops through the anatomical network or that neurons are also signalling through non-wired means.\n\nMost neuron pairs exhibited variability across trials and animals: downstream neurons responded to some instances of upstream stimulations but not others (Extended Data Fig. 6a); and the response's amplitude, temporal shape and even sign also varied (Extended Data Fig. 6b\u2013e). Some variability in the downstream response can be attributed to variability in the upstream neuron's response to its own stimulation, called its autoresponse. To study the variability of signal propagation excluding variability from the autoresponse, we calculated a kernel for each stimulation that evoked a downstream response. The kernel gives the activity of the downstream neuron when convolved with the activity of the upstream neuron. The kernel describes how the signal is transformed from upstream to downstream neuron for that stimulus event, including the timescales of the signal transfer (Extended Data Fig. 6b,c). We characterized the variability of each functional connection by comparing how these kernels transform a standard stimulus (Extended Data Fig. 6e).

Direct connections are suited for questions of gene expression, development and anatomy, but less so for network function. For example, a direct connection between two neurons could be slow or weak, but might overlook a fast and strong effective connection via other paths through the network.\n\nWe used a connectome-constrained biophysical model to provide additional evidence to support our claim that measured signal propaga\u00adtion differs from expectations based on anatomy. The model relies on assumptions of timescales, nonlinearities and other parameters that, if incorrect, would contribute to the observed disagreement between anatomy and function. But even without any biophysical model, dis\u00adcrepancies between anatomy and function are apparent; for example, in pairs of neurons with synaptic connections that are functionally non-connected (Fig. 2g), and in strong functional connections between RID and other neurons that have only weak, variable and indirect syn\u00adaptic connections (Fig. 4). The challenge of confidently constraining model parameters from anatomy highlights the need for functional measurements, like the ones performed here. These functional meas\u00adurements fill in fundamental gaps in the translation from anatomical connectome to neural activity. An alternative approach for comparing structure and function would be to infer properties of direct connec\u00adtions from the measured effective connections55, but this might require a higher signal-to-noise ratio than our current measurements.\n\nThe signal propagation atlas presented here informs structure\u2013function investigations at both the circuit and the network level, and enables more accurate brain-wide simulations of neural dynamics. The finding that extrasynaptic peptidergic signalling, which is invisible to anatomy, evokes neural dynamics in C. elegans will inform ongoing discussions about how to characterize other brains in more detail and on a larger scale.\n\nthe measured kernels, thereby avoiding the need for many assump\u00adtions; and second, it captures extrasynaptic signalling not visible from anatomy.\n\n## Discussion\n\nSignal propagation in C. elegans measured by neural activation differs from model predictions based on anatomy, in part because anatomy does not account for wireless connections such as the extrasynaptic release of neuropeptides49.\n\nBy directly evoking calcium activity on a timescale of seconds, extra\u00adsynaptic signalling serves a functional role similar to that of classical neurotransmitters and contributes to neural dynamics. This role is in addition to its better-characterized role in modulating neural excit\u00adability over longer timescales.\n\nPeptidergic extrasynaptic signalling relies on diffusion and therefore may be uniquely well suited to C. elegans' small size. Mammals also express neuropeptides and receptors, including in the cortex50, but their larger brains might limit the speed, strength or spatial extent of peptidergic extrasynaptic signalling.\n\nPlasticity, neuromodulation, neural-network state, experience dependence and other longer-timescale effects might contribute to variability in our measured responses or to discrepancies between anatomical and functional descriptions of the C. elegans network. A future direction will be to search for latent connections that might become functional only during certain internal states.\n\nOur signal propagation map provides a lower bound on the num\u00adber of functional connections (Supplementary Information). Our measurements required a trade-off between the animal's health and its transgenic load. To express the necessary transgenes, we gener\u00adated a strain that is not behaviourally wild type; its signal propagation might therefore also differ from the wild type.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5157, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36f418ef-9689-4cdb-946b-479c7594e51b": {"__data__": {"id_": "36f418ef-9689-4cdb-946b-479c7594e51b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "411364c7-82c2-4ab5-b436-858e83feddc2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "974439930062eaeb2b83ebde552aba4efc0f3c2f5a84daa16e150ea4af774f5b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ae1bab3f-9bf6-466a-8a1b-2f02bee83e6b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "58e34de52fc26810ec63fdbfa8b58b67e3500be725103229f0548c958df953d1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "24414e57-eee4-4e0d-813e-2c4a99cdcaab", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d5fa43159cc4a2717b54b956bd3b2472270b1078232edba694e00aa1c997d468", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Mammals also express neuropeptides and receptors, including in the cortex50, but their larger brains might limit the speed, strength or spatial extent of peptidergic extrasynaptic signalling.\n\nPlasticity, neuromodulation, neural-network state, experience dependence and other longer-timescale effects might contribute to variability in our measured responses or to discrepancies between anatomical and functional descriptions of the C. elegans network.

Strains generated in this study (Extended Data Fig. 1a) have been deposited in the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC), University of Minnesota, for public distribution. Hermaphrodites were used in this study.\n\n## Transgenics\n\nWe generated a transgenic worm for interrogating signal propagation, TWISP (AML462), which has been described in more detail previously23. This strain expresses the calcium indicator GCaMP6s in the nucleus of each neuron; a purple-light-sensitive optogenetic protein system (GUR-3 and PRDX-2) in each neuron; and multiple fluorophores of various colours from the NeuroPAL27 system, also in the nucleus of neurons. We also used a QF-hGR drug-inducible gene-expression strategy to turn on the gene expression of optogenetic actuators only later in development. To create this strain, we first generated an intermediate strain, AML456, by injecting a plasmid mix (75 ng \u03bcl\u22121 pAS3-5xQUAS::\u0394 pes-10P::AI::gur-3G::unc-54 + 75 ng \u03bcl\u22121 pAS3-5xQUAS::\u0394 pes-10P::AI::prdx-2G::unc-54 + 35 ng \u03bcl\u22121 pAS-3-rab-3P::AI::QF+GR::unc-54 + 100 ng \u03bcl\u22121 unc-122::GFP) into CZ20310 worms, followed by UV integration and six outcrosses56,57. The intermediate strain, AML456, was then crossed into the pan-neuronal GCaMP6s calcium-imaging strain, with NeuroPAL, AML320 (refs. 23,27,58).\n\nAnimals exhibited decreased average locomotion compared to the WT (mean speeds of 0.03 mm s\u22121 off drug and 0.02 mm s\u22121 on drug compared to the mean of 0.15 mm s\u22121 in WT animals23), as expected for NeuroPAL GCaMP6s strains, which are also reported to be overall less active (around 0.09 mm s\u22121 during only forward locomotion)27.\n\nAn unc-31-mutant background with defects in the dense-core-vesicle-release pathway was used to diminish wireless signalling53. We created an unc-31-knockout version of our functional connectivity strain by performing CRISPR\u2013Cas9-mediated genome editing on AML462 using a single-strand oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN)-based homology-dependent repair strategy59. This approach resulted in strain AML508 (unc-31 (wtf502) IV; otIs669 (NeuroPAL) V 14x; wtfIs145 (30 ng \u03bcl\u22121 pBX + 30 ng \u03bcl\u22121 rab-3::his-24::GCaMP6s::unc-54); wtfIs348 (75 ng \u03bcl\u22121 pAS3-5xQUAS::\u0394 pes-10P::AI::gur-3G::unc-54 + 75 ng \u03bcl\u22121 pAS3-5xQUAS::\u0394 pes-10P::AI::prdx-2G::unc-54 + 35 ng \u03bcl\u22121 pAS-3-rab-3P::QF+GR::unc-54 + 100 ng \u03bcl\u22121 unc-122::GFP)).\n\nCRISPR\u2013Cas-9 editing was carried out as follows. Protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sites (denoted in upper case) were selected in the first intron (gagcuucgcaauguugacucCGG) and the last intron (augguacauuggguccguggCGG) of the unc-31 gene (ZK897.1a.1) to delete 12,476 out of 13,169 bp (including the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions) and 18 out of 20 exons from the genomic locus, while adding 6 bp (GGTACC) for the Kpn-I restriction site (Extended Data Fig. 1b).

Cas9 Nuclease V3 (1 \u03bcl of 10 \u03bcg \u03bcl\u22121), 0.25 \u03bcl of 1 M KCL, 0.375 \u03bcl of 200 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), sgRNAs for unc-31 (1 \u03bcl each for both sites) and 0.75 \u03bcl for dpy-10 from a stock of 100 \u03bcM, ssODNs (1 \u03bcl for unc-31 and 0.5 \u03bcl for dpy-10 from a stock of 25 \u03bcM) and nuclease-free water to a final volume of 10 \u03bcl in a PCR tube, kept on ice. The injection mix was then incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min before it was injected into the germline of AML462 worms. Progenies from plates showing roller or dumpy phenotypes in the F1 generation after injection were individually propagated and screened by PCR and Kpn-I digestion to confirm deletion. Single-worm PCR was carried out using GXL-PRIME STAR taq-Polymerase (Takara Bio) and the Kpn-1-HF restriction enzyme (NEB). Worms without a roller or dumpy phenotype and homozygous for deletion were confirmed by Sanger sequencing fragment analysis.\n\nTo cross-validate GUR-3/PRDX-2-evoked behaviour responses, we generated the transgenic strain AML546 by injecting a plasmid mix (40 ng \u03bcl\u22121 pAS3-rig-3P::AI::gur-3G::SL2::tagRFP::unc-54 + 40 ng \u03bcl\u22121 pAS3-rig-3P::AI::prdx-2G::SL2::tagBFP::unc-54) into N2 worms to generate a transient transgenic line expressing GUR-3/PRDX-2 in AVA neurons.\n\n## Cross-validation of GUR-3/PRDX-2-evoked behaviour\n\nOptogenetic activation of AVA neurons using traditional channelrhodopsins (for example, Chrimson) leads to reversals45,60. We used worms expressing GUR-3/PRDX-2 in AVA neurons (AML564) to show that GUR-3/PRDX-2 elicits a similar behavioural response. We illuminated freely moving worms with blue light from an LED (peaked at 480 nm, 2.3 mW mm\u22122) for 45 s. We compared the number of onsets of reversals in that period of time with a control in which only dim white light was present, as well as with the results of the same assay performed on N2 worms.

Dexamethasone (dex) activates QF-hGR to temporally control the expression of downstream targets61, in this case the optogenetic proteins in the functional connectivity imaging strains AML462 and AML508. Dex-NGM plates were prepared by adding 200 \u03bcM of dex in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) just before pouring the plate. For dex treatment, L2/L3 worms were transferred to overnight-seeded dex-NGM plates and further grown until worms were ready for imaging. More details of the dex treatment are provided below.\n\nWe prepared stock solution of 100 mM dex by dissolving 1 g dexamethasone (D1756, Sigma-Aldrich) in 25.5 ml DMSO (D8418, Sigma-Aldrich). Stocks were then filter-sterilized, aliquoted, wrapped in foil to prevent light and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until needed. The 200-\u03bcM dex-NGM plates were made by adding 2 ml of 100 mM dex stock in 1 l NGM-agar medium, while stirring, 5 min before pouring the plate. Dex plates were stored at 4 \u00b0C for up to a month until needed.\n\n## Preparation of worms for imaging\n\nWorms were individually mounted on 10% agarose pads prepared with M9 buffer and immobilized using 2 \u03bcl of 100-nm polystyrene beads solution and 2 \u03bcl of levamisole (500 \u03bcM stock). This concentration of levamisole, after dilution in the polystyrene bead solution and the agarose pad water, largely immobilized the worm while still allowing it to slightly move, especially before placing the coverslip. Pharyngeal pumping was observed during imaging.\n\n## Overview of the imaging strategy\n\nWe combined whole-brain calcium imaging through spinning disk single-photon confocal microscopy62,63 with two-photon64 targeted optogenetic stimulation65, each with their own remote focusing system, to measure and manipulate neural activity in an immobilized animal (Fig. 1a). We performed calcium imaging, with excitation light at a wavelength and intensity that does not elicit photoactivation of GUR-3/PRDX-2 (ref. 66) (Extended Data Fig. 2b). We also used genetically encoded fluorophores from NeuroPAL expressed in each neuron27 to identify neurons consistently across animals (Fig. 1c).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4919, "end_char_idx": 7801, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "343ee6e9-c0c3-4d23-ab83-3b28820da968": {"__data__": {"id_": "343ee6e9-c0c3-4d23-ab83-3b28820da968", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "27062c31-3308-4856-b5b7-6f5da77d390c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "a8305d17a1f570c867c4b049720ab362956cfe1264c9d789d961be3bb0412077", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f596702d-e5ef-44d1-952a-aba685b00abb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6cf6b86150c9da7ccc5e98b46b42aac6e1ad02a22286c133a5ed2e46007fa9e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Article\n\n## Multi-channel imaging and neural identification\n\nVolumetric, multi-channel imaging was performed to capture images of the following fluorophores in the NeuroPAL transgene: mtagBFP2, CyOFP1.5, tagRFP-T and mNeptune2.5 (ref. 27). Light downstream of the same spinning disk unit used for calcium imaging travelled on an alternative light path through channel-specific filters mounted on a mechanical filter wheel, while mechanical shutters alternated illumination with the respective lasers, similar to a previously described method58. Channels were as follows: mtagBFP2 was imaged using a 405-nm laser and a Semrock FF01-440/40 emission filter; CyOFP1.5 was imaged using a 505-nm laser and a Semrock 609/54 emission filter; tagRFP-T was imaged using a 561-nm laser and a Semrock 609/54-nm emission filter; and mNeptune2.5 was imaged using a 561-nm laser and a Semrock 732/68-nm emission filter.\n\nAfter the functional connectivity recording was complete, neuron identities were manually assigned by comparing each neuron's colour, position and size to a known atlas. Some neurons are particularly hard to identify in NeuroPAL and are therefore absent or less frequently identified in our recordings. Some neurons have dim tagRFP-T expression, which makes it difficult for the neuron segmentation algorithm to find them and, therefore, to extract their calcium activity. These neurons include, for example, AVB, ADF and RID. RID's distinctive position and its expression of CyOFP allowed us nevertheless to manually target it optogenetically. Neurons in the ventral ganglion are hard to identify because it appears as very crowded when viewed in the most common orientation that worms assume when mounted on a microscope slide. Neurons in the ventral ganglion are therefore sometimes difficult to distinguish from one another, especially for dimmer neurons such as the SIA, SIB and RMF neurons. In our strain, the neurons AWCon and AWCoff were difficult to tell apart on the basis of colour information.\n\n## Volumetric image acquisition\n\nNeural activity was recorded at whole-brain scale and cellular resolution through continuous acquisition of volumetric images in the red and green channels with a spinning disk confocal unit and using LabView software (https://github.com/leiferlab/pump-probe-acquisition/tree/ pp), similarly to a previous study67, with a few upgrades. The imaging focal plane was scanned through the brain of the worm remotely using an electrically tunable lens (Optotune EL-16-40-TC) instead of moving the objective. The use of remote focusing allowed us to decouple the z-position of the imaging focal plane and that of the optogenetics two-photon spot (described below).\n\nImages were acquired by an sCMOS camera, and each acquired image frame was associated to the focal length of the tunable lens (z-position in the sample) at which it was acquired. To ensure the correct association between frames and z-position, we recorded the analogue signal describing the focal length of the tunable lens at time points synchronous with a trigger pulse output by the camera. By counting the camera triggers from the start of the recording, the z-positions could be associated to the correct frame, bypassing unknown operating-system-mediated latencies between the image stream from the camera and the acquisition of analogue signals.\n\nIn addition, real-time 'pseudo'-segmentation of the neurons (described below) required the ability to separate frames into corresponding volumetric images in real time. Because the z-position was acquired at a low sample rate, splitting of volumes on the basis of finite differences between successive z-positions could lead to errors in assignment at the edge of the z-scan. An analogue OP-AMP-based differentiator was used to independently detect the direction of the z-scan in hardware.\n\n## Calcium imaging\n\nCalcium imaging was performed in a single-photon regime with a 505-nm excitation laser through spinning disk confocal microscopy, at 2 vol s\u22121. For functional connectivity experiments, an intensity of 1.4 mW mm\u22122 at the sample plane was used to image GCaMP6s, well below the threshold needed to excite the GUR-3/ PRDX-2 optogenetic system24.

We note that at this wavelength and intensity, animals exhibited very little spontaneous calcium activity.\n\nFor certain analyses (Fig. 6), recordings with ample spontaneous activity were desired. In those cases, we increased the 505-nm intensity sevenfold, to approximately 10 mW mm\u22122, and recorded from AML320 strains that lacked exogenous GUR-3/PRDX-2 to avoid potential widespread neural activation. Under these imaging conditions, we observed population-wide slow stereotyped spontaneous oscillatory calcium dynamics, as previously reported35,68.\n\n## Extraction of calcium activity from the images\n\nCalcium activity was extracted from the raw images by using Python libraries implementing optimized versions of a previously described algorithm69, available at https://www.github.com/leiferlab/pump-probe, https://www.github.com/leiferlab/wormdatamodel, https:// www.github.com/leiferlab/wormneuronsegmentation-c and https:// www.github.com/leiferlab/wormbrain.\n\nThe positions of neurons in each acquired volume were determined by computer vision software implemented in C++. This software was greatly optimized to identify neurons in real time, to also enable closed-loop targeting and stimulus delivery (as described in 'Stimulus delivery and pulsed laser'). Two design choices made this algorithm considerably faster than previous approaches. First, a local maxima search was used instead of a slower watershed-type segmentation. The nuclei of C. elegans neurons are approximately spheres and so they can be identified and separated by a simple local maxima search. Second, we factorized the three-dimensional (3D) local maxima search into multiple two-dimensional (2D) local maxima searches. In fact, any local maximum in a 3D image is also a local maximum in the 2D image in which it is located. Local maxima were therefore first found in each 2D image separately, and then candidate local maxima were discarded or retained by comparing them to their immediate surroundings in the other planes. This makes the algorithm less computationally intensive and fast enough to also be used in real time. We refer to this type of algorithm as 'pseudo'-segmentation because it finds the centre of neurons without fully describing the extent and boundaries of each neuron.\n\nAfter neural locations were found in each of the volumetric images, a nonrigid point-set registration algorithm was used to track their locations across time, matching neurons identified in a given 3D image to the neurons identified in a 3D image chosen as reference. Even worms that are mechanically immobilized still move slightly and contract their pharynx, thereby deforming their brain and requiring the tracking of neurons. We implemented in C++ a fast and optimized version of the Dirichelet\u2013Student's-t mixture model (DSMM)70.\n\n## Calcium pre-processing\n\nThe GCaMP6s intensity extracted from the images undergoes the following pre-processing steps. (1) Missing values are interpolated on the basis of neighbouring time points. Missing values can occur when a neuron cannot be identified in a given volumetric image. (2) Photobleaching is removed by fitting a double exponential to the baseline signal. (3) Outliers more than 5 standard deviations away from the average are removed from each trace. (4) Traces are smoothed using a causal polynomial filtering with a window size of 6.5 s and polynomial order of 1 (Savitzky\u2013Golay filters with windows completely 'in the past'; for example, obtained with scipy.signal.savgol_coeffs(window_length=13, polyorder=1, pos=12)). This type of filter with the chosen parameters is able to remove noise without smearing the traces in time. Note that when fits are performed (for example, to calculate kernels), they are always performed on the original, non-smoothed traces.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3528, "end_char_idx": 8004, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6cea924d-45b7-4805-b5e9-4644ad078a4e": {"__data__": {"id_": "6cea924d-45b7-4805-b5e9-4644ad078a4e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "00814fef-bf40-42b0-9ddd-f140959d65dd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "87ad76990e29e5e9cd6ce89e5075d0c44cb30396bb4e5116a292f518e404df4b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e02bffa4-f81f-46cf-92f0-9ea07a7ec5e5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "296de47f83ba1b36b126b3cae5e2fa4a1e146c9941073c86140bc3e0b0353202", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "(5) Where \u0394F/F0 of responses is used, F0 is defined as the value of F in a 30-s interval before the stimulation time and \u0394F = F \u2212 F0. In Fig. 2a, for example, <\u0394F/F0>t refers to the mean over a 30-s post-stimulus window.\n\n## Stimulus delivery and pulsed laser\n\nFor two-photon optogenetic targeting, we used an optical parametric amplifier (OPA; Light Conversion ORPHEUS) pumped by a femtosecond amplified laser (Light Conversion PHAROS). The output of the OPA was tuned to a wavelength of 850 nm, at a 500 kHz repetition rate. We used temporal focusing to spatially restrict the size of the two-photon excitation spot along the microscope axis. A motorized iris was used to set its lateral size. For temporal focusing, the first-order diffraction from a reflective grating, oriented orthogonally to the microscope axis, was collected (as described previously71) and travelled through the motorized iris, placed on a plane conjugate to the grating. To arbitrarily position the two-photon excitation spot in the sample volume, the beam then travelled through an electrically tunable lens (Optotune EL-16-40-TC, on a plane conjugate to the objective), to set its position along the microscope axis, and finally was reflected by two galvo-mirrors to set its lateral position. The pulsed beam was then combined with the imaging light path by a dichroic mirror immediately before entering the back of the objective.\n\nMost of the stimuli were delivered automatically by computer control. Real-time computer vision software found the position of the neurons for each volumetric image acquired, using only the tagRFP-T channel. To find neural positions, we used the same pseudo-segmentation algorithm described above. The algorithm found neurons in each 2D frame in around 500 \u03bcs as the frames arrived from the camera. In this way, locations for all neurons in a volume were found within a few milliseconds of acquiring the last frame of that volume.\n\nEvery 30 s, a random neuron was selected among the neurons found in the current volumetric image, on the basis of only its tagRFP-T signal. After galvo-mirrors and the tunable lens set the position of the two-photon spot on that neuron, a 500-ms (300-ms for the unc-31-mutant strain) train of light pulses was used to optogenetically stimulate that neuron. The duration of stimulus illumination for the unc-31-mutant strain was selected to elicit calcium transients in stimulated neurons with a distribution of amplitudes such that the maximum amplitude was similar to those in WT-background animals, (Extended Data Fig. 2f). The output of the laser was controlled through the external interface to its built-in pulse picker, and the power of the laser at the sample was 1.2 mW at 500 kHz. Neuron identities were assigned to stimulated neurons after the completion of experiments using NeuroPAL27.\n\nTo probe the AFD\u2192AIY neural connection, a small set of stimuli used variable pulse durations from 100 ms to 500 ms in steps of 50 ms selected randomly to vary the amount of optogenetic activation of AFD.\n\nIn some cases, neurons of interest were too dim to be detected by the real-time software. For those neurons of interest, additional recordings were performed in which the neuron to be stimulated was manually selected on the basis of its colour, size and position. This was the case for certain stimulations of neurons RID and AFD.\n\n## Characterization of the size of the two-photon excitation spot\n\nThe lateral (xy) size of the two-photon excitation spot was measured with a fluorescent microscope slide, and the axial (z) size was measured using 0.2-nm fluorescent beads (Suncoast Yellow, Bangs Laboratories), by scanning the z-position of the optogenetic spot while maintaining the imaging focal plane fixed (Extended Data Fig. 2a).\n\nWe further tested our targeted stimulation in two ways: selective photobleaching and neuronal activation. First, we targeted individual neurons at various depths in the worm's brain, and we illuminated them with the pulsed laser to induce selective photobleaching of tagRFP-T. Extended Data Fig. 2c,d shows how our two-photon excitation spot selectively targets individual neurons, because it photobleaches tagRFP-T only in the neuron that we decide to target, and not in nearby neurons.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4270, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e02bffa4-f81f-46cf-92f0-9ea07a7ec5e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "e02bffa4-f81f-46cf-92f0-9ea07a7ec5e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "00814fef-bf40-42b0-9ddd-f140959d65dd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "87ad76990e29e5e9cd6ce89e5075d0c44cb30396bb4e5116a292f518e404df4b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6cea924d-45b7-4805-b5e9-4644ad078a4e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "2b7e3d6a5c6f6b34406dc06825dbe67d7c7a855d8681f44a015db29abc1f21be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0d8f6dc4-ee97-4780-b069-e3aa4785712b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5f20ce7a698b975effcccdae0dc9d5d3932e8b7911351e928ab712a3c0cea745", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "## Characterization of the size of the two-photon excitation spot\n\nThe lateral (xy) size of the two-photon excitation spot was measured with a fluorescent microscope slide, and the axial (z) size was measured using 0.2-nm fluorescent beads (Suncoast Yellow, Bangs Laboratories), by scanning the z-position of the optogenetic spot while maintaining the imaging focal plane fixed (Extended Data Fig. 2a).\n\nWe further tested our targeted stimulation in two ways: selective photobleaching and neuronal activation.

When the excitation was directed at the neuron but shifted by 4 \u03bcm along z, the neuron showed no activation. By contrast, the neuron showed activation when the spot was correctly positioned on the neuron (Extended Data Fig. 2e). To further show that our stimulation is spatially restricted to an individual neuron more broadly throughout our measurements, we show that stimulations do not elicit responses in most of the close neighbours of the targeted neurons (Extended Data Fig. 2i and Supplementary Information).\n\n## Inclusion criteria\n\nStimulation events were included for further analysis if they evoked a detectable calcium response in the stimulated neuron (autoresponse). A classifier determined whether the response was detected by inspecting whether the amplitude of both the \u0394F/F0 transient and its second derivative exceeded a pair of thresholds. The same threshold values were applied to every animal, strain, neuron and stimulation event, and were originally set to match the human perception of a response above noise. Stimulation events that did not meet both thresholds for a contiguous 4 s were excluded. The RID responses shown in Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 7c are an exception to this policy. RID is visible on the basis of its CyOFP expression, but its tagRFP-T expression is too dim to consistently extract calcium signals. Therefore, in Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 7c (but not in other figures, such as Fig. 2), downstream neurons' responses to RID stimulation were included even in cases in which it was not possible to extract a calcium-activity trace in RID.\n\nNeuron traces were excluded from analysis if a human was unable to assign an identity or if the imaging time points were absent in a contiguous segment longer than 5% of the response window owing to imaging artefacts or tracking errors. A different policy applies to dim neurons of interest that are not automatically detected by the pseudo-segmentation algorithm in the 3D image used as reference for the point-set registration algorithm. In those cases, we manually added the position of those neurons to the reference 3D image. If these 'added' neurons are automatically detected in most of the other 3D images, then a calcium activity trace can be successfully produced by the DSMM nonrigid registration algorithm, and is treated as any other trace. However, if the 'added' neurons are too dim to be detected also in the other 3D images and the calcium activity trace cannot be formed for more than 50% of the total time points, the activity trace for those neurons is extracted from the neuron's position as determined from the position of neighbouring neurons. In the analysis code, we refer to these as 'matchless' traces, because the reference neuron is not matched to any detected neuron in the specific 3D image, but its position is just transformed according to the DSMM nonrigid deformation field. In this way, we are able to recover the calcium activity of some neurons whose tagRFP-T expression is otherwise too dim to be reliably detected by the pseudo-segmentation algorithm. Responses to RID stimulation shown in Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 7c are an exception to this policy.

If the downstream neuron did not show a response, we considered the downstream response to be below the noise level and the kernel to be zero.\n\n## Statistical analysis\n\nWe used two statistical tests to identify neuron pairs that under our stimulation and imaging conditions can be deemed 'functionally connected', 'functionally non-connected' or for which we lack the confidence to make either determination. Both tests compare observed calcium transients in each downstream neuron to a null distribution of transients recorded in experiments lacking stimulation.\n\nTo determine whether a pair of neurons can be deemed functionally connected, we calculated the probability of observing the measured calcium response in the downstream neuron given no neural stimulation. We used a two-sided Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test to compare the distributions of the downstream neuron's \u0394F/F\u2080 amplitude and its temporal second derivative from all observations of that neuron pair under stimulation to the empirical null distributions taken from control recordings lacking stimulation. P values were calculated separately for \u0394F/F\u2080 and its temporal second derivative, and then combined using Fischer's method to report a single fused P value for each neuron pair. Finally, to account for the large number of hypotheses tested, a false discovery rate was estimated. From the list of P values, each neuron was assigned a q value using the Storey\u2013Tibshirani method\u2074\u2070. q values are interpreted as follows: when considering an ensemble of putative functional connections of q values all less than or equal to q\u2080, an approximately q\u2080 fraction of those connections would have appeared in a recording that lacked any stimulation.\n\nTo explicitly test whether a pair of neurons are functionally not connected, taking into account the amplitude of the response, their reliability, the number of observations and multiple hypotheses, we also computed equivalence P_eq and q_eq values. This assesses the confidence of a pair not being connected. We test whether our response is equivalent to what we would expect from our control distribution using the two one-sided t-test (TOST)\u2077\u00b2. We computed P_eq values for \u0394F/F\u2080 and its temporal second derivative for a given pair being equivalent to the control distributions within an \u03b5 = 1.2 \u03c3_\u0394F/F\u2080,\u2202\u00b2t. Here, \u03c3_\u0394F/F\u2080,\u2202\u00b2t is the standard deviation of the corresponding control distribution. We then combined the two P_eq values into a single one with the Fisher method and computed q_eq values using the Storey\u2013Tibshirani method\u2074\u2070. Note that, different from the regular P values described above, the equivalence test relies on the arbitrary choice of \u03b5, which defines when we call two distributions equivalent. We chose a conservative value of \u03b5 = 1.2\u03c3.\n\nWe note that the statistical framework is stringent and a large fraction of measured neuron pairs fail to pass either statistical test.\n\n## Measuring path length through the synaptic network\n\nTo find the minimum path length between neurons in the anatomical network topology, we proceeded iteratively. We started from the original binary connectome and computed the map of strictly two-hop connections by looking for pairs of neurons that are not connected in the starting connectome (the actual anatomical connectome at the first step) but that are connected through a single intermediate neuron. To generate the strictly three-hop connectome, we repeated this procedure using the binary connectome including direct and two-hop connections, as the starting connectome. This process continued iteratively to generate the strictly n-hop connectome.\n\nIn the anatomical connectome (the starting connectome for the first step in the procedure above), a neuron was considered to be directly anatomically connected if the connectomes of any of the four L4 or adult individuals in refs. 1 and 6 contained at least one synaptic contact between them. Note that this is a permissive description of anatomical connections, as it considers even neurons with only a single synaptic contact in only one individual to be connected.\n\n## Fitting kernels\n\nKernels k_ij(t) were defined as the functions to be convolved with the activity \u0394F_i of the stimulated neuron to obtain the activity \u0394F_j of a responding neuron i, such that \u0394F_j(t) = (k_ij * \u0394F_i)(t).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4480, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "73113d43-4cf4-4c76-899b-3b59df70acaf": {"__data__": {"id_": "73113d43-4cf4-4c76-899b-3b59df70acaf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a02a9e07-c52c-4d97-a45e-244fd903a766", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "cb7bbe2601c64b49a0150d2918d957bff5678fc914b5eaa579bdd2baf95520ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "07833de9-9c03-415e-93d7-967f881d0b5e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 13](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "3897d7a5c9a555bdafa951d7a9bb925a750078cd7495ab52af51dc8382f62279", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a640be83-88fa-409a-9ef9-46c8aef4ff2c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6966e63adf4f886f8972214ffef625e2371e31ea864cee0343d6391c908262fd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "This process continued iteratively to generate the strictly n-hop connectome.\n\nIn the anatomical connectome (the starting connectome for the first step in the procedure above), a neuron was considered to be directly anatomically connected if the connectomes of any of the four L4 or adult individuals in refs. 1 and 6 contained at least one synaptic contact between them.

To fit kernels, each kernel k(t) was parametrized as a sum of convolutions of decaying exponentials\n\n$$k(t) = \\sum_m c_m(\u03b8(t)e^{-\u03b3_{m,0}t}) * \u03b8(t)e^{-\u03b3_{m,1}t} * \\ldots,$$\n\nwhere the indices i, j are omitted for clarity and \u03b8 is the Heaviside function. This parametrization is exact for linear systems, and works as a description of causal signal transmission also in nonlinear systems. Note that increasing the number of terms in the successive convolutions does not lead to overfitting, as would occur by increasing the degree of a polynomial. Overfitting could occur by increasing the number of terms in the sum, which in our fitting is constrained to be a maximum of 2. The presence of two terms in the sum allows the kernels to represent signal transmission with saturation (with c\u2080 and c\u2081 of opposite signs) and assume a fractional-derivative-like shape.\n\nThe convolutions are performed symbolically. The construction of kernels as in equation (1) starts from a symbolically stored, normalized decaying exponential kernel with a factor A_\u03b3,0 \u03b8(t)e^(-\u03b3\u2080t). Convolutions with normalized exponentials \u03b3_n \u03b8(t)e^(-\u03b3_n t) are performed sequentially and symbolically, taking advantage of the fact that successive convolutions of exponentials always produce a sum of functions in the form \u221d \u03b8(t)t^n e^(-\u03b3t). Once rules are found to convolve an additional exponential with a function in that form, any number of successive convolution can be performed. These rules are as follows:\n\n1.

(1) We computed the responses of all the neurons i to the stimulation of a neuron j chosen to drive activity in the network. To compute the responses, for each pair i, j, we used the kernel (ki,j(t))trials averaged over multiple trials. For kernel-based analysis, pairs with connections of q > 0.05 were considered not connected. We set the activity \u0394Fj(t) in the driving neuron to mimic an empirically observed representative activity transient. (2) We computed the correlation coefficient of the resulting activities. (3) We repeated steps 1 and 2 for a set of driving neurons (all or top-n neurons, as in Fig. 6).

In brief, this simulation approach uses differential equations to model signal transmission through electrical and chemical synapses and includes a nonlinear equation for synaptic activation variables. We injected current in silico into individual neurons and simulated the responses of all the other neurons.

In all other cases, synapse weights were taken as the scaled average of three adult connectomes1,6 and an L4 connectome6, and polarities were assigned on the basis of a gene-expression analysis of ligand-gated ionotropic synaptic connections that considered glutamate, acetylcholine and GABA neurotransmitter and receptor expression, as performed in a previous study37 and taken from CeNGEN38 and other sources. Specifically, we used a previously published dataset (S1 data in ref. 37) and aggregated polarities across all members of a cellular subtype (for example, polarities from source AVAL and AVAR were combined). In cases of ambiguous polarities, connections were assumed to be excitatory, as in the previous study37. For other biophysical parameters we chose values commonly used in C. elegans modelling efforts9,30,47,73.\n\n## Characterizing stereotypy of functional connections\n\nTo characterize the stereotypy of a neuron pair's functional connection, its kernels were inspected. A kernel was calculated for every stimulus-response event in which both the upstream and downstream neuron exhibited activity that exceeded a threshold. At least two stimulus-response events that exceeded this threshold were required to calculate their stereotypy. The general strategy for calculating stereotypy was to convolve different kernels with the same stimulus inputs and compare the resulting outputs. The similarity of two outputs is reported as a Pearson's correlation coefficient. Kernels corresponding to different stimulus-response events of the same pair of neurons were compared with one another round-robin style, one round-robin each for a given input stimulus. For inputs we chose the set of all stimuli delivered to the upstream neuron. The neuron-pairs stereotypy is reported as the average Pearson's correlation coefficient across all round-robin kernel pairings and across all stimuli.\n\n## Rise time of kernels\n\nThe rise time of kernels, shown in Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 6d, was defined as the interval between the earliest time at which the value of the kernel was 1/e its peak value and the time of its peak (whether positive or negative). The rise time was zero if the peak of the kernel was at time t = 0. However, saturation of the signal transmission can make kernels appear slower than the connection actually is. For example, the simplest instantaneous connection would be represented by a single decaying exponential in equation (1), which would have its peak at time t = 0. However, if that connection is saturating, a second, opposite-sign term in the sum is needed to fit the kernel. This second term would make the kernel have a later peak, thereby masking the instantaneous nature of the connection.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4645, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1530b6b9-b9c8-4701-81ee-c729d7775be4": {"__data__": {"id_": "1530b6b9-b9c8-4701-81ee-c729d7775be4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "efbbc95c-3d63-40a0-90e8-e0c5fc68dd61", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "6f74011191ea3b2e1d5dc3b390f6b6234f62505f91019942bcdff2d21a183c98", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a99d17b8-acbf-47bf-9d6c-baa9c566c165", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "e3055e530dda6170b7f392f01d2e148b4e91fac87153a9bf578fb447407be75a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "## Rise time of kernels\n\nThe rise time of kernels, shown in Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 6d, was defined as the interval between the earliest time at which the value of the kernel was 1/e its peak value and the time of its peak (whether positive or negative).

However, if that connection is saturating, a second, opposite-sign term in the sum is needed to fit the kernel. This second term would make the kernel have a later peak, thereby masking the instantaneous nature of the connection. To account for this effect of saturation, we removed terms representing saturation from the kernels and found the rise time of these 'non-saturating' kernels.\n\n## Screen for purely extrasynaptic-dependent connections\n\nTo find candidate purely extrasynaptic-dependent connections, we considered the pairs of neurons that are connected in WT animals (qWT < 0.05) and non-connected in unc-31 animals (qunc-31 > 0.05, with the additional condition qunc-31eq > 0.05 to exclude very small responses that are nonetheless significantly different from the control distribution). We list these connections and provide additional examples in Extended Data Fig. 9.\n\nUsing a recent neuropeptide-GPCR interaction screen in C. elegans52 and gene-expression data from CeNGEN38, we find putative combinations of neuropeptides and GPCRs that can mediate those connections (Supplementary Table 1). We produced such a list of neuropeptide and GPCR combinations using the Python package Worm Neuro Atlas (https://github.com/francescorandi/wormneuroatlas). In the list, we only include transcripts from CeNGEN detected with the highest confidence (threshold 4), as described previously51. For each neuron pair, we first searched the CeNGEN database for neuropeptides expressed in the upstream neuron, then identified potential GPCR targets for each neuropeptide using information from previous reports52,74, and finally went back to the CeNGEN database to find whether the downstream neuron in the pair was among the neurons expressing the specific GPCRs. The existence of potential combinations of neuropeptide and GPCR putatively mediating signalling supports our observation that communication in the candidate neuron pairs that we identify can indeed be mediated extrasynaptically through neuropeptidergic machinery.\n\n## Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nMachine-readable datasets containing the measurements from this work are publicly accessible through on Open Science Foundation repository at https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/E2SYT.

Difference image shows tagRFP-T fluorescence merged with a false-colour blue-green image to reveal change in intensity after targeted illumination. Only targeted neuron and not nearby neurons appear photobleached. Insets shows zoomed-in image of the targeted neuron's original tagRFP-T intensity (left) and difference image (right).

We recorded from >113 individual WT-background animals and performed over 20,000 pairwise\n                  stimulus response measurements. Sample size was chosen to be many fold larger than typical C. elegans calcium imaging experiments in the\n                  field, e.g. Hallinen et al., elife 2021.\n\nData exclusions   Inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in the \"Inclusion criteria\" subsection of the Methods, and pasted here:\n                  Stimulation events were included for further analysis if they evoked a detectable calcium response in the stimulated neuron (autoresponse). A\n                  classifier determined whether the response was detected by inspecting whether the amplitude of both the DF/F transient and its second\n                  derivative exceeded a pair of thresholds. The same threshold values were applied to every animal, strain, neuron and stimulation event, and\n                  were originally set to match human perception of a response above noise. Stimulation events that did not meet both thresholds for a\n                  contiguous 4 seconds were excluded. RID responses shown in Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 7c are an exception to this policy. RID is visible\n                  based on its CyOFP expression, but its tagRFP-T expression is too dim to consistently extract calcium signals. Therefore in Fig. 4 and Extended\n                  Data Fig. 7c (but not in other figures, like Fig. 2) responses to RID stimulation were included even in cases where it was not possible to extract\n                  a calcium-activity trace in RID.\n\n                  Neuron traces were excluded from analysis if a human was unable to assign an identity or if the imaging time points were absent in a\n                  contiguous segment longer than 5% of the response window due to imaging artifacts or tracking errors. A different policy applies to dim\n                  neurons of interest that are not automatically detected by the \"pseudo\"-segmentation algorithm in the 3D image used as reference for the\n                  pointset registration algorithm. In those cases, we manually added the position of those neurons to the reference 3D image. If these \"added\"\n                  neurons are automatically detected in most of the other 3D images, then a calcium activity trace can be successfully produced by the DSMM\n                  nonrigid registration algorithm and is treated as any other trace. However, if the \"added\" neurons are too dim to be detected also in the\n                  other 3D images and the calcium activity trace cannot be formed for more than 50% of the total time points, the activity trace for those\n                  neurons is extracted from the neuron's position as determined from the position of neighboring neurons. In the analysis code, we refer to\n                  these as \"matchless\" traces, because the reference neuron is not matched to any detected neuron in the specific 3D image, but its position is\n                  just transformed according to the DSMM nonrigid deformation field.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4906, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2038c01-8869-4f39-9246-e4ffa88c1182": {"__data__": {"id_": "f2038c01-8869-4f39-9246-e4ffa88c1182", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 27](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "330a01ab-b52d-40ba-876e-c553c63ea3ea", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 27](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "7735235b9e3185f724f888a8110fc09875e4270f52c6b4c31bbf2357cd6685de", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a4064481-2de2-4ad1-9640-6ff45e427236", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 27](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "ed18a9a4e7aa5aa38a065f516640454b2dbf8edc2e3db6a7fd0973b7388abaec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "In those cases, we manually added the position of those neurons to the reference 3D image.

Here, to better understand the relationship between the structure and the function of a nervous system, we systematically measure signal propagation in 23,433 pairs of neurons across the head of the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans* by direct optogenetic activation and simultaneous whole-brain calcium imaging. We measure the sign (excitatory or inhibitory), strength, temporal properties and causal direction of signal propagation between these neurons to create a functional atlas. We find that signal propagation differs from model predictions that are based on anatomy. Using mutants, we show that extrasynaptic signalling not visible from anatomy contributes to this difference. We identify many instances of dense-core-vesicle-dependent signalling, including on timescales of less than a second, that evoke acute calcium transients\u2014often where no direct wired connection exists but where relevant neuropeptides and receptors are expressed. We propose that, in such cases, extrasynaptically released neuropeptides serve a similar function to that of classical neurotransmitters. Finally, our measured signal propagation atlas better predicts the neural dynamics of spontaneous activity than do models based on anatomy. We conclude that both synaptic and extrasynaptic signalling drive neural dynamics on short timescales, and that measurements of evoked signal propagation are crucial for interpreting neural function.\n\nBrain connectivity mapping is motivated by the claim that \"nothing defines the function of a neuron more faithfully than the nature of its inputs and outputs\"2. This approach to revealing neural function drives large-scale efforts to generate connectomes\u2014anatomical maps of the synaptic contacts of the brain\u2014in a diverse set of organisms, ranging from mice3 to *Platynereis*4. The *C. elegans* connectome1,5,6 is the most mature of these efforts, and has been used to reveal circuit-level mechanisms of sensorimotor processing7,8, to constrain models of neural dynamics9 and to make predictions of neural function10.\n\nAnatomy, however, omits key aspects of neurons' inputs and outputs, or leaves them ambiguous: the strength and sign (excitatory or inhibitory) of a neural connection are not always evident from wiring or gene expression. Many mammalian neurons release both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, and functional measurements are thus required to disambiguate their connections11. For example, starburst amacrine cells release both GABA (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid) and acetylcholine12; neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus release both serotonin and glutamate13; and neurons in the ventral tegmental area release two or more of dopamine, GABA and glutamate14. The timescale of neural signalling is also ambiguous from anatomy. In addition, anatomy disregards changes to neural connections from plasticity or neuromodulation; for example, in the head compass circuit in *Drosophila*15 or in the crab stomatogastric ganglion16, respectively. Both mechanisms serve to strengthen or to select subsets of neural connections out of a menu of possible latent circuits. Finally, anatomy ignores neural signalling that occurs outside the synapse, as explored here. These ambiguities or omissions all pose challenges for revealing neural function from anatomy.\n\nA more direct way to probe neural function is to measure signal propagation by perturbing neural activity and measuring the responses of other neurons. Measuring signal propagation captures the strength and sign of neural connections reflecting plasticity, neuromodulation and even extrasynaptic signalling. Moreover, direct measures of signal propagation allow us to define mathematical relations that describe how the activity of an upstream neuron drives activity in a downstream neuron, including its temporal response profile. Historically, this and related perturbative approaches have been called many names (Supplementary Information), but they all stand in contrast to correlative approaches that seek to infer neural function from activity correlations alone.

To overcome the challenges associated with spectral overlap between the actuator and the indicator, we used TWISP\u2014 a transgenic worm for interrogating signal propagation23, which expresses a purple-light actuator, GUR-3/PRDX-2 (refs. 24,25) and a nuclear-localized calcium indicator GCaMP6s (ref. 26) in each neuron (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 2b), along with fluorophores for neural identification from NeuroPAL (ref. 27) (Fig. 1c). Validation of the GUR-3/ PRDX-2 system is discussed in the Supplementary Information (see also Extended Data Fig. 2h and Supplementary Video 1). A drug-inducible gene-expression system was used to avoid toxicity during development, resulting in animals that were viable but still significantly less active than WT animals23 (see Methods). A stimulus duration of 0.3 s or 0.5 s was chosen to evoke modest calcium responses (Extended Data Fig. 2f), similar in amplitude to those evoked naturally by odour stimuli28.\n\nMany neurons exhibited calcium activity in response to the activation of one or more other neurons (Fig. 1d). A downstream neuron's response to a stimulated neuron is evidence that a signal propagated from the stimulated neuron to the downstream neuron.\n\nWe highlight three examples from the motor circuit (Fig. 1e\u2013g). Stimulation of the interneuron AVJR evoked activity in AVDR (Fig. 1e). AVJ had been predicted to coordinate locomotion after egg-laying by promoting forward movements29. The activity of AVD is associated with sensory-evoked (but not spontaneous) backward locomotion7,8,30,31, and AVD receives chemical and electrical synaptic input from AVJ1,6. Therefore, both wiring and our functional measurements suggest that AVJ has a role in coordinating backward locomotion, in addition to its previously described roles in egg-laying and forward locomotion.\n\nActivation of the premotor interneuron AVER evoked activity transients in AVAR (Fig. 1f). Both AVA31\u201335 (Extended Data Fig. 2h) and AVE31,36 are implicated in backward movement. Their activities are correlated31, and AVE makes gap-junction and many chemical synaptic contacts with AVA1,6.\n\nActivation of the turning-associated neuron SAADL36 inhibited the activity of the sensory neuron OLLR. SAAD had been predicted to inhibit OLL, on the basis of gene-expression measurements37. SAAD is cholinergic and it makes chemical synapses to OLL, which expresses an acetylcholine-gated chloride channel, LGC-47 (refs. 6,38,39). Other examples consistent with the literature are reported in Extended Data Table 1.\n\n## Signal propagation map\n\nWe generated a signal propagation map by aggregating downstream responses to stimulation from 113 C. elegans individuals (Fig. 2a). We report the mean calcium response in a 30-s time window \u0394F/F0t, averaged across trials and animals (Extended Data Fig. 3a). We imaged activity in response to stimulation for 23,433 pairs of neurons (66% of all possible pairs in the head). Measured pairs were imaged at least once, and some as many as 59 times (Extended Data Figs. 3b and 4a). This includes activity from 186 of 188 neurons in the head, or 99% of all head neurons.\n\nWe developed a statistical framework, described in the Methods, to identify neuron pairs that can be deemed 'functionally connected' (q < 0.05; Extended Data Fig. 4b), 'functionally non-connected' (qeq < 0.05; Extended Data Fig. 5b) or for which we lack the confidence to make either determination. The statistical framework is conservative and requires consistent and reliable responses (or non-responses) compared to an empirical null distribution, considering effect size, sample size and multiple-hypothesis testing40 to make either determination. Many neuron pairs fail to pass either statistical test, even though they often contain neural activity that, when observed in isolation, could easily be classified as a response (for example, AVJR\u2192ASGR in Extended Data Fig. 4c).\n\nOur signal propagation map comprises the response amplitude and its associated q value (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4108, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cbebbf58-3bbb-4374-bdb8-b7f6281b8e8e": {"__data__": {"id_": "cbebbf58-3bbb-4374-bdb8-b7f6281b8e8e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f27a7c7f-e4b9-485b-9814-1942a6aa1e0d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "28f47474e5f0bcd785efc76dcb22319ca67aee64fc19f4ed64c4f5c6340af1db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c8919370-d80a-43ab-b642-52d355ea4790", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "1512e915d639ebce94de4984875665b274b819d01b373eca80bacd30ec6c87eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ec94fd79-794a-47c9-886d-6e62b5b72ae2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1315e6c3a296ca09cc750aad7d6529892d828d4163bd72fd3f46d5cbe57daf28", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "We developed a statistical framework, described in the Methods, to identify neuron pairs that can be deemed 'functionally connected' (q < 0.05; Extended Data Fig. 4b), 'functionally non-connected' (qeq < 0.05; Extended Data Fig. 5b) or for which we lack the confidence to make either determination.

A total of 1,310 of the 23,433 measured neuron pairs, or 6%, pass our stringent criteria to be deemed functionally connected at q < 0.05 (Fig. 2c). Neuron pairs that are deemed functionally non-connected are reported in Extended Data Fig. 5b. Note that, in all cases, functional connections refer to 'effective connections' because they represent the propagation of signals over all paths in the network between the stimulated and the responding neuron, not just the direct (monosynaptic) connections between them.\n\nC. elegans neuron subtypes typically consist of two bilaterally symmetric neurons, often connected by gap junctions, that have similar wiring1 and gene expression38, and correlated activity41. As expected, bilaterally symmetric neurons are (eight times) more likely to be functionally connected than are pairs of neurons chosen at random (Fig. 2c).\n\nThe balance of excitation and inhibition is important for a network's stability42,43 but has not to our knowledge been previously measured in the worm. Our measurements indicate that 11% of q < 0.05 functional connections are inhibitory (Fig. 2d), comparable to previous estimates of around 20% of synaptic contacts in C. elegans37 or around 20% of cells in the mammalian cortex44. Our estimate is likely to be a lower bound, because we assume that we only observe inhibition in neurons that already have tonic activity.\n\nAs expected from anatomy, neuron pairs that had direct (monosynaptic) wired connections were more likely to be functionally connected than were neurons with only indirect or multi-hop anatomical connections. Similarly, the likelihood of functional connections decreased as the minimal path length through the anatomical network increased (Fig. 2e). Conversely, neurons that had large minimal path lengths through the anatomical network were more likely to be functionally non-connected than were neurons that had a single-hop minimal path length (Fig. 2g). We investigated how far responses to neural stimulation penetrate into the anatomical network. Functionally connected (q < 0.05) neurons were on average connected by a minimal anatomical path length of 2.1 hops (Fig. 2f), suggesting that neural signals often propagate multiple hops through the anatomical network or that neurons are also signalling through non-wired means.\n\nMost neuron pairs exhibited variability across trials and animals: downstream neurons responded to some instances of upstream stimulations but not others (Extended Data Fig. 6a); and the response's amplitude, temporal shape and even sign also varied (Extended Data Fig. 6b\u2013e). Some variability in the downstream response can be attributed to variability in the upstream neuron's response to its own stimulation, called its autoresponse. To study the variability of signal propagation excluding variability from the autoresponse, we calculated a kernel for each stimulation that evoked a downstream response. The kernel gives the activity of the downstream neuron when convolved with the activity of the upstream neuron. The kernel describes how the signal is transformed from upstream to downstream neuron for that stimulus event, including the timescales of the signal transfer (Extended Data Fig. 6b,c). We characterized the variability of each functional connection by comparing how these kernels transform a standard stimulus (Extended Data Fig. 6e).

As expected, kernels from one neuron pair were more similar to each other than to kernels from other pairs (Extended Data Fig. 6f).\n\n## Functional measurements differ from anatomy\n\nWe observed an apparent contradiction with the wiring diagram\u2014 a large fraction of neuron pairs with monosynaptic (single-hop) wired connections are deemed functionally non-connected in our\n\n408 | Nature | Vol 623 | 9 November 2023", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6812, "end_char_idx": 8237, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b692a469-d9c2-47cb-a0ec-df1fb676921c": {"__data__": {"id_": "b692a469-d9c2-47cb-a0ec-df1fb676921c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "23ad2266-1382-4946-8c4f-c42147d17e69", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "84a87113a8b5165737f40e32389d4fc6e51db914713c245b78dea5c12f262454", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Signal propagation map of C. elegans\n\n## Fig. 2 | Signal propagation map of C. elegans. \n\n### a, Mean post-stimulus neural activity (\u0394F/F0) averaged across trials and individuals. \n\nThe q values report the false discovery rate (more grey is less significant).

To further compare our measurements to anatomy, we sought to better understand what responses we should expect from the wiring diagram.

Spontaneous activity was measured in immobilized worms lacking optogenetic actuators under bright imaging conditions. A matrix of bare anatomical weights (synapse counts) was a poor predictor of the correlations of spontaneous activity (left bar, Fig. 6), consistent with previous reports27,41. The connectome-constrained biophysical model from Fig. 3 better predicted spontaneous activity correlations (middle bars, Fig. 6; described in the Methods)\u2014as we would expect because it considers all anatomical paths through the network\u2014but it still performed fairly poorly. Predictions based on our functional measurements of signal propagation kernels (right bars, Fig. 6) performed best of all at predicting spontaneous activity correlations. To generate predictions of correlations either from the biophysical model or from our functional kernel measurements required the activity of a set of neurons to be driven in silico. For the biophysical model, driving all neurons was optimal, but for the kernel-based predictions, driving a specific set of six neurons ('top-n') markedly improved performance. We conclude that functionally derived predictions based on our measured signal propagation kernels better agree with spontaneous activity than do either a bare description of anatomical weights or an established model constrained by the connectome, and that some subsets of neurons make outsized contributions to driving spontaneous dynamics.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4054, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "166842ae-0e97-4779-9d20-94f69114e6fa": {"__data__": {"id_": "166842ae-0e97-4779-9d20-94f69114e6fa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7975c544-1232-455f-8fef-15d4f016fd68", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "8efcd2cafdaae31f6be8e0787a84eeaed52f5a95e7571a02fb2848aca003f0c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cb1da95a-e5a7-4988-8512-dc8691846bb7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 7](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "59038b468a3889deef82d982adce9b01a0453359310300f9ea80a9995ed38dfd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "3 better predicted spontaneous activity correlations (middle bars, Fig. 6; described in the Methods)\u2014as we would expect because it considers all anatomical paths through the network\u2014but it still performed fairly poorly.

For the biophysical model, driving all neurons was optimal, but for the kernel-based predictions, driving a specific set of six neurons ('top-n') markedly improved performance. We conclude that functionally derived predictions based on our measured signal propagation kernels better agree with spontaneous activity than do either a bare description of anatomical weights or an established model constrained by the connectome, and that some subsets of neurons make outsized contributions to driving spontaneous dynamics. The kernel-based simulation (interactive version at https://funsim.princeton.edu) outperforms other models of neural dynamics presumably for two reasons: first, it extracts all relevant parameters directly from", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2961, "end_char_idx": 4265, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd8afca1-6de1-4b3e-873e-007f005f2872": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd8afca1-6de1-4b3e-873e-007f005f2872", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "085e4f5b-fe82-446b-96b6-17dde4150ef2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "974439930062eaeb2b83ebde552aba4efc0f3c2f5a84daa16e150ea4af774f5b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "607971e0-4911-4f37-b909-a21cf75b3eea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b6bd018d29e0b24505696ead9cbb1918128835ddd097c07bb1690e4da57c4e93", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Figure 6\n\n## Fig. 6: Measured signal propagation better predicts spontaneous activity than anatomy does.\n\nAgreement (as Pearson's correlation coefficient (coeff.)) between the correlation matrix of spontaneous activity recorded from an immobilized animal and various predictions of those correlations, including: the bare anatomical weight matrix (synapse counts) (left); correlations predicted by the anatomy-derived biophysical model (middle); and correlations functionally derived from the measured signal propagation kernels (right).

Direct connections are suited for questions of gene expression, development and anatomy, but less so for network function. For example, a direct connection between two neurons could be slow or weak, but might overlook a fast and strong effective connection via other paths through the network.\n\nWe used a connectome-constrained biophysical model to provide additional evidence to support our claim that measured signal propaga\u00adtion differs from expectations based on anatomy. The model relies on assumptions of timescales, nonlinearities and other parameters that, if incorrect, would contribute to the observed disagreement between anatomy and function. But even without any biophysical model, dis\u00adcrepancies between anatomy and function are apparent; for example, in pairs of neurons with synaptic connections that are functionally non-connected (Fig. 2g), and in strong functional connections between RID and other neurons that have only weak, variable and indirect syn\u00adaptic connections (Fig. 4). The challenge of confidently constraining model parameters from anatomy highlights the need for functional measurements, like the ones performed here. These functional meas\u00adurements fill in fundamental gaps in the translation from anatomical connectome to neural activity. An alternative approach for comparing structure and function would be to infer properties of direct connec\u00adtions from the measured effective connections55, but this might require a higher signal-to-noise ratio than our current measurements.\n\nThe signal propagation atlas presented here informs structure\u2013function investigations at both the circuit and the network level, and enables more accurate brain-wide simulations of neural dynamics. The finding that extrasynaptic peptidergic signalling, which is invisible to anatomy, evokes neural dynamics in C. elegans will inform ongoing discussions about how to characterize other brains in more detail and on a larger scale.\n\nthe measured kernels, thereby avoiding the need for many assump\u00adtions; and second, it captures extrasynaptic signalling not visible from anatomy.\n\n## Discussion\n\nSignal propagation in C. elegans measured by neural activation differs from model predictions based on anatomy, in part because anatomy does not account for wireless connections such as the extrasynaptic release of neuropeptides49.\n\nBy directly evoking calcium activity on a timescale of seconds, extra\u00adsynaptic signalling serves a functional role similar to that of classical neurotransmitters and contributes to neural dynamics. This role is in addition to its better-characterized role in modulating neural excit\u00adability over longer timescales.\n\nPeptidergic extrasynaptic signalling relies on diffusion and therefore may be uniquely well suited to C. elegans' small size. Mammals also express neuropeptides and receptors, including in the cortex50, but their larger brains might limit the speed, strength or spatial extent of peptidergic extrasynaptic signalling.\n\nPlasticity, neuromodulation, neural-network state, experience dependence and other longer-timescale effects might contribute to variability in our measured responses or to discrepancies between anatomical and functional descriptions of the C. elegans network. A future direction will be to search for latent connections that might become functional only during certain internal states.\n\nOur signal propagation map provides a lower bound on the num\u00adber of functional connections (Supplementary Information). Our measurements required a trade-off between the animal's health and its transgenic load.

Strains generated in this study (Extended Data Fig. 1a) have been deposited in the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC), University of Minnesota, for public distribution. Hermaphrodites were used in this study.\n\n## Transgenics\n\nWe generated a transgenic worm for interrogating signal propagation, TWISP (AML462), which has been described in more detail previously23. This strain expresses the calcium indicator GCaMP6s in the nucleus of each neuron; a purple-light-sensitive optogenetic protein system (GUR-3 and PRDX-2) in each neuron; and multiple fluorophores of various colours from the NeuroPAL27 system, also in the nucleus of neurons. We also used a QF-hGR drug-inducible gene-expression strategy to turn on the gene expression of optogenetic actuators only later in development. To create this strain, we first generated an intermediate strain, AML456, by injecting a plasmid mix (75 ng \u03bcl\u22121 pAS3-5xQUAS::\u0394 pes-10P::AI::gur-3G::unc-54 + 75 ng \u03bcl\u22121 pAS3-5xQUAS::\u0394 pes-10P::AI::prdx-2G::unc-54 + 35 ng \u03bcl\u22121 pAS-3-rab-3P::AI::QF+GR::unc-54 + 100 ng \u03bcl\u22121 unc-122::GFP) into CZ20310 worms, followed by UV integration and six outcrosses56,57. The intermediate strain, AML456, was then crossed into the pan-neuronal GCaMP6s calcium-imaging strain, with NeuroPAL, AML320 (refs. 23,27,58).\n\nAnimals exhibited decreased average locomotion compared to the WT (mean speeds of 0.03 mm s\u22121 off drug and 0.02 mm s\u22121 on drug compared to the mean of 0.15 mm s\u22121 in WT animals23), as expected for NeuroPAL GCaMP6s strains, which are also reported to be overall less active (around 0.09 mm s\u22121 during only forward locomotion)27.\n\nAn unc-31-mutant background with defects in the dense-core-vesicle-release pathway was used to diminish wireless signalling53. We created an unc-31-knockout version of our functional connectivity strain by performing CRISPR\u2013Cas9-mediated genome editing on AML462 using a single-strand oligodeoxynucleotide (ssODN)-based homology-dependent repair strategy59. This approach resulted in strain AML508 (unc-31 (wtf502) IV; otIs669 (NeuroPAL) V 14x; wtfIs145 (30 ng \u03bcl\u22121 pBX + 30 ng \u03bcl\u22121 rab-3::his-24::GCaMP6s::unc-54); wtfIs348 (75 ng \u03bcl\u22121 pAS3-5xQUAS::\u0394 pes-10P::AI::gur-3G::unc-54 + 75 ng \u03bcl\u22121 pAS3-5xQUAS::\u0394 pes-10P::AI::prdx-2G::unc-54 + 35 ng \u03bcl\u22121 pAS-3-rab-3P::QF+GR::unc-54 + 100 ng \u03bcl\u22121 unc-122::GFP)).\n\nCRISPR\u2013Cas-9 editing was carried out as follows. Protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sites (denoted in upper case) were selected in the first intron (gagcuucgcaauguugacucCGG) and the last intron (augguacauuggguccguggCGG) of the unc-31 gene (ZK897.1a.1) to delete 12,476 out of 13,169 bp (including the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions) and 18 out of 20 exons from the genomic locus, while adding 6 bp (GGTACC) for the Kpn-I restriction site (Extended Data Fig. 1b).

An injection mix was prepared by sequentially adding Alt-R S.p. Cas9 Nuclease V3 (1 \u03bcl of 10 \u03bcg \u03bcl\u22121), 0.25 \u03bcl of 1 M KCL, 0.375 \u03bcl of 200 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), sgRNAs for unc-31 (1 \u03bcl each for both sites) and 0.75 \u03bcl for dpy-10 from a stock of 100 \u03bcM, ssODNs (1 \u03bcl for unc-31 and 0.5 \u03bcl for dpy-10 from a stock of 25 \u03bcM) and nuclease-free water to a final volume of 10 \u03bcl in a PCR tube, kept on ice. The injection mix was then incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min before it was injected into the germline of AML462 worms. Progenies from plates showing roller or dumpy phenotypes in the F1 generation after injection were individually propagated and screened by PCR and Kpn-I digestion to confirm deletion. Single-worm PCR was carried out using GXL-PRIME STAR taq-Polymerase (Takara Bio) and the Kpn-1-HF restriction enzyme (NEB). Worms without a roller or dumpy phenotype and homozygous for deletion were confirmed by Sanger sequencing fragment analysis.\n\nTo cross-validate GUR-3/PRDX-2-evoked behaviour responses, we generated the transgenic strain AML546 by injecting a plasmid mix (40 ng \u03bcl\u22121 pAS3-rig-3P::AI::gur-3G::SL2::tagRFP::unc-54 + 40 ng \u03bcl\u22121 pAS3-rig-3P::AI::prdx-2G::SL2::tagBFP::unc-54) into N2 worms to generate a transient transgenic line expressing GUR-3/PRDX-2 in AVA neurons.\n\n## Cross-validation of GUR-3/PRDX-2-evoked behaviour\n\nOptogenetic activation of AVA neurons using traditional channelrhodopsins (for example, Chrimson) leads to reversals45,60. We used worms expressing GUR-3/PRDX-2 in AVA neurons (AML564) to show that GUR-3/PRDX-2 elicits a similar behavioural response. We illuminated freely moving worms with blue light from an LED (peaked at 480 nm, 2.3 mW mm\u22122) for 45 s. We compared the number of onsets of reversals in that period of time with a control in which only dim white light was present, as well as with the results of the same assay performed on N2 worms.

Dexamethasone (dex) activates QF-hGR to temporally control the expression of downstream targets61, in this case the optogenetic proteins in the functional connectivity imaging strains AML462 and AML508. Dex-NGM plates were prepared by adding 200 \u03bcM of dex in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) just before pouring the plate. For dex treatment, L2/L3 worms were transferred to overnight-seeded dex-NGM plates and further grown until worms were ready for imaging. More details of the dex treatment are provided below.\n\nWe prepared stock solution of 100 mM dex by dissolving 1 g dexamethasone (D1756, Sigma-Aldrich) in 25.5 ml DMSO (D8418, Sigma-Aldrich). Stocks were then filter-sterilized, aliquoted, wrapped in foil to prevent light and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until needed. The 200-\u03bcM dex-NGM plates were made by adding 2 ml of 100 mM dex stock in 1 l NGM-agar medium, while stirring, 5 min before pouring the plate. Dex plates were stored at 4 \u00b0C for up to a month until needed.\n\n## Preparation of worms for imaging\n\nWorms were individually mounted on 10% agarose pads prepared with M9 buffer and immobilized using 2 \u03bcl of 100-nm polystyrene beads solution and 2 \u03bcl of levamisole (500 \u03bcM stock). This concentration of levamisole, after dilution in the polystyrene bead solution and the agarose pad water, largely immobilized the worm while still allowing it to slightly move, especially before placing the coverslip. Pharyngeal pumping was observed during imaging.\n\n## Overview of the imaging strategy\n\nWe combined whole-brain calcium imaging through spinning disk single-photon confocal microscopy62,63 with two-photon64 targeted optogenetic stimulation65, each with their own remote focusing system, to measure and manipulate neural activity in an immobilized animal (Fig. 1a). We performed calcium imaging, with excitation light at a wavelength and intensity that does not elicit photoactivation of GUR-3/PRDX-2 (ref. 66) (Extended Data Fig. 2b). We also used genetically encoded fluorophores from NeuroPAL expressed in each neuron27 to identify neurons consistently across animals (Fig. 1c).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4919, "end_char_idx": 7801, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55f8f5be-2946-4fb6-a386-a6488a2c2076": {"__data__": {"id_": "55f8f5be-2946-4fb6-a386-a6488a2c2076", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9c2f7fbe-8164-46dc-83dc-f8d3fb574af3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "a8305d17a1f570c867c4b049720ab362956cfe1264c9d789d961be3bb0412077", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a1a68873-4dba-4b58-8ec9-a196100bcf12", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6cf6b86150c9da7ccc5e98b46b42aac6e1ad02a22286c133a5ed2e46007fa9e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Article\n\n## Multi-channel imaging and neural identification\n\nVolumetric, multi-channel imaging was performed to capture images of the following fluorophores in the NeuroPAL transgene: mtagBFP2, CyOFP1.5, tagRFP-T and mNeptune2.5 (ref. 27). Light downstream of the same spinning disk unit used for calcium imaging travelled on an alternative light path through channel-specific filters mounted on a mechanical filter wheel, while mechanical shutters alternated illumination with the respective lasers, similar to a previously described method58. Channels were as follows: mtagBFP2 was imaged using a 405-nm laser and a Semrock FF01-440/40 emission filter; CyOFP1.5 was imaged using a 505-nm laser and a Semrock 609/54 emission filter; tagRFP-T was imaged using a 561-nm laser and a Semrock 609/54-nm emission filter; and mNeptune2.5 was imaged using a 561-nm laser and a Semrock 732/68-nm emission filter.\n\nAfter the functional connectivity recording was complete, neuron identities were manually assigned by comparing each neuron's colour, position and size to a known atlas. Some neurons are particularly hard to identify in NeuroPAL and are therefore absent or less frequently identified in our recordings. Some neurons have dim tagRFP-T expression, which makes it difficult for the neuron segmentation algorithm to find them and, therefore, to extract their calcium activity. These neurons include, for example, AVB, ADF and RID. RID's distinctive position and its expression of CyOFP allowed us nevertheless to manually target it optogenetically. Neurons in the ventral ganglion are hard to identify because it appears as very crowded when viewed in the most common orientation that worms assume when mounted on a microscope slide. Neurons in the ventral ganglion are therefore sometimes difficult to distinguish from one another, especially for dimmer neurons such as the SIA, SIB and RMF neurons. In our strain, the neurons AWCon and AWCoff were difficult to tell apart on the basis of colour information.\n\n## Volumetric image acquisition\n\nNeural activity was recorded at whole-brain scale and cellular resolution through continuous acquisition of volumetric images in the red and green channels with a spinning disk confocal unit and using LabView software (https://github.com/leiferlab/pump-probe-acquisition/tree/ pp), similarly to a previous study67, with a few upgrades. The imaging focal plane was scanned through the brain of the worm remotely using an electrically tunable lens (Optotune EL-16-40-TC) instead of moving the objective. The use of remote focusing allowed us to decouple the z-position of the imaging focal plane and that of the optogenetics two-photon spot (described below).\n\nImages were acquired by an sCMOS camera, and each acquired image frame was associated to the focal length of the tunable lens (z-position in the sample) at which it was acquired. To ensure the correct association between frames and z-position, we recorded the analogue signal describing the focal length of the tunable lens at time points synchronous with a trigger pulse output by the camera. By counting the camera triggers from the start of the recording, the z-positions could be associated to the correct frame, bypassing unknown operating-system-mediated latencies between the image stream from the camera and the acquisition of analogue signals.\n\nIn addition, real-time 'pseudo'-segmentation of the neurons (described below) required the ability to separate frames into corresponding volumetric images in real time. Because the z-position was acquired at a low sample rate, splitting of volumes on the basis of finite differences between successive z-positions could lead to errors in assignment at the edge of the z-scan. An analogue OP-AMP-based differentiator was used to independently detect the direction of the z-scan in hardware.\n\n## Calcium imaging\n\nCalcium imaging was performed in a single-photon regime with a 505-nm excitation laser through spinning disk confocal microscopy, at 2 vol s\u22121. For functional connectivity experiments, an intensity of 1.4 mW mm\u22122 at the sample plane was used to image GCaMP6s, well below the threshold needed to excite the GUR-3/ PRDX-2 optogenetic system24. We note that at this wavelength and intensity, animals exhibited very little spontaneous calcium activity.\n\nFor certain analyses (Fig. 6), recordings with ample spontaneous activity were desired.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4407, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a1a68873-4dba-4b58-8ec9-a196100bcf12": {"__data__": {"id_": "a1a68873-4dba-4b58-8ec9-a196100bcf12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9c2f7fbe-8164-46dc-83dc-f8d3fb574af3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "a8305d17a1f570c867c4b049720ab362956cfe1264c9d789d961be3bb0412077", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "55f8f5be-2946-4fb6-a386-a6488a2c2076", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 11](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "63d2a54764aa9d646bfa9c01d5e88c15f988de3112f4fa4757ba0280e6440fff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Because the z-position was acquired at a low sample rate, splitting of volumes on the basis of finite differences between successive z-positions could lead to errors in assignment at the edge of the z-scan.

For functional connectivity experiments, an intensity of 1.4 mW mm\u22122 at the sample plane was used to image GCaMP6s, well below the threshold needed to excite the GUR-3/ PRDX-2 optogenetic system24. We note that at this wavelength and intensity, animals exhibited very little spontaneous calcium activity.\n\nFor certain analyses (Fig. 6), recordings with ample spontaneous activity were desired. In those cases, we increased the 505-nm intensity sevenfold, to approximately 10 mW mm\u22122, and recorded from AML320 strains that lacked exogenous GUR-3/PRDX-2 to avoid potential widespread neural activation. Under these imaging conditions, we observed population-wide slow stereotyped spontaneous oscillatory calcium dynamics, as previously reported35,68.\n\n## Extraction of calcium activity from the images\n\nCalcium activity was extracted from the raw images by using Python libraries implementing optimized versions of a previously described algorithm69, available at https://www.github.com/leiferlab/pump-probe, https://www.github.com/leiferlab/wormdatamodel, https:// www.github.com/leiferlab/wormneuronsegmentation-c and https:// www.github.com/leiferlab/wormbrain.\n\nThe positions of neurons in each acquired volume were determined by computer vision software implemented in C++. This software was greatly optimized to identify neurons in real time, to also enable closed-loop targeting and stimulus delivery (as described in 'Stimulus delivery and pulsed laser'). Two design choices made this algorithm considerably faster than previous approaches. First, a local maxima search was used instead of a slower watershed-type segmentation. The nuclei of C. elegans neurons are approximately spheres and so they can be identified and separated by a simple local maxima search. Second, we factorized the three-dimensional (3D) local maxima search into multiple two-dimensional (2D) local maxima searches. In fact, any local maximum in a 3D image is also a local maximum in the 2D image in which it is located. Local maxima were therefore first found in each 2D image separately, and then candidate local maxima were discarded or retained by comparing them to their immediate surroundings in the other planes. This makes the algorithm less computationally intensive and fast enough to also be used in real time. We refer to this type of algorithm as 'pseudo'-segmentation because it finds the centre of neurons without fully describing the extent and boundaries of each neuron.\n\nAfter neural locations were found in each of the volumetric images, a nonrigid point-set registration algorithm was used to track their locations across time, matching neurons identified in a given 3D image to the neurons identified in a 3D image chosen as reference. Even worms that are mechanically immobilized still move slightly and contract their pharynx, thereby deforming their brain and requiring the tracking of neurons. We implemented in C++ a fast and optimized version of the Dirichelet\u2013Student's-t mixture model (DSMM)70.\n\n## Calcium pre-processing\n\nThe GCaMP6s intensity extracted from the images undergoes the following pre-processing steps. (1) Missing values are interpolated on the basis of neighbouring time points. Missing values can occur when a neuron cannot be identified in a given volumetric image. (2) Photobleaching is removed by fitting a double exponential to the baseline signal. (3) Outliers more than 5 standard deviations away from the average are removed from each trace. (4) Traces are smoothed using a causal polynomial filtering with a window size of 6.5 s and polynomial order of 1 (Savitzky\u2013Golay filters with windows completely 'in the past'; for example, obtained with scipy.signal.savgol_coeffs(window_length=13, polyorder=1, pos=12)). This type of filter with the chosen parameters is able to remove noise without smearing the traces in time. Note that when fits are performed (for example, to calculate kernels), they are always performed on the original, non-smoothed traces.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3528, "end_char_idx": 8004, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0b8fc768-9b68-4a3d-9171-10744bfcf436": {"__data__": {"id_": "0b8fc768-9b68-4a3d-9171-10744bfcf436", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "532a41ea-e89e-426a-a617-7d4bed59363b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "87ad76990e29e5e9cd6ce89e5075d0c44cb30396bb4e5116a292f518e404df4b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e5b3570c-0ca4-4662-87bd-ccad0a6908f3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "296de47f83ba1b36b126b3cae5e2fa4a1e146c9941073c86140bc3e0b0353202", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "(5) Where \u0394F/F0 of responses is used, F0 is defined as the value of F in a 30-s interval before the stimulation time and \u0394F = F \u2212 F0. In Fig. 2a, for example, <\u0394F/F0>t refers to the mean over a 30-s post-stimulus window.\n\n## Stimulus delivery and pulsed laser\n\nFor two-photon optogenetic targeting, we used an optical parametric amplifier (OPA; Light Conversion ORPHEUS) pumped by a femtosecond amplified laser (Light Conversion PHAROS). The output of the OPA was tuned to a wavelength of 850 nm, at a 500 kHz repetition rate. We used temporal focusing to spatially restrict the size of the two-photon excitation spot along the microscope axis. A motorized iris was used to set its lateral size. For temporal focusing, the first-order diffraction from a reflective grating, oriented orthogonally to the microscope axis, was collected (as described previously71) and travelled through the motorized iris, placed on a plane conjugate to the grating. To arbitrarily position the two-photon excitation spot in the sample volume, the beam then travelled through an electrically tunable lens (Optotune EL-16-40-TC, on a plane conjugate to the objective), to set its position along the microscope axis, and finally was reflected by two galvo-mirrors to set its lateral position. The pulsed beam was then combined with the imaging light path by a dichroic mirror immediately before entering the back of the objective.\n\nMost of the stimuli were delivered automatically by computer control. Real-time computer vision software found the position of the neurons for each volumetric image acquired, using only the tagRFP-T channel. To find neural positions, we used the same pseudo-segmentation algorithm described above. The algorithm found neurons in each 2D frame in around 500 \u03bcs as the frames arrived from the camera. In this way, locations for all neurons in a volume were found within a few milliseconds of acquiring the last frame of that volume.\n\nEvery 30 s, a random neuron was selected among the neurons found in the current volumetric image, on the basis of only its tagRFP-T signal. After galvo-mirrors and the tunable lens set the position of the two-photon spot on that neuron, a 500-ms (300-ms for the unc-31-mutant strain) train of light pulses was used to optogenetically stimulate that neuron. The duration of stimulus illumination for the unc-31-mutant strain was selected to elicit calcium transients in stimulated neurons with a distribution of amplitudes such that the maximum amplitude was similar to those in WT-background animals, (Extended Data Fig. 2f). The output of the laser was controlled through the external interface to its built-in pulse picker, and the power of the laser at the sample was 1.2 mW at 500 kHz. Neuron identities were assigned to stimulated neurons after the completion of experiments using NeuroPAL27.\n\nTo probe the AFD\u2192AIY neural connection, a small set of stimuli used variable pulse durations from 100 ms to 500 ms in steps of 50 ms selected randomly to vary the amount of optogenetic activation of AFD.\n\nIn some cases, neurons of interest were too dim to be detected by the real-time software. For those neurons of interest, additional recordings were performed in which the neuron to be stimulated was manually selected on the basis of its colour, size and position. This was the case for certain stimulations of neurons RID and AFD.\n\n## Characterization of the size of the two-photon excitation spot\n\nThe lateral (xy) size of the two-photon excitation spot was measured with a fluorescent microscope slide, and the axial (z) size was measured using 0.2-nm fluorescent beads (Suncoast Yellow, Bangs Laboratories), by scanning the z-position of the optogenetic spot while maintaining the imaging focal plane fixed (Extended Data Fig. 2a).\n\nWe further tested our targeted stimulation in two ways: selective photobleaching and neuronal activation. First, we targeted individual neurons at various depths in the worm's brain, and we illuminated them with the pulsed laser to induce selective photobleaching of tagRFP-T. Extended Data Fig. 2c,d shows how our two-photon excitation spot selectively targets individual neurons, because it photobleaches tagRFP-T only in the neuron that we decide to target, and not in nearby neurons.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4270, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e5b3570c-0ca4-4662-87bd-ccad0a6908f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "e5b3570c-0ca4-4662-87bd-ccad0a6908f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "532a41ea-e89e-426a-a617-7d4bed59363b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "87ad76990e29e5e9cd6ce89e5075d0c44cb30396bb4e5116a292f518e404df4b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0b8fc768-9b68-4a3d-9171-10744bfcf436", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 12](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "2b7e3d6a5c6f6b34406dc06825dbe67d7c7a855d8681f44a015db29abc1f21be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6d691929-78e6-4b83-94f1-ae35d2c71533", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5f20ce7a698b975effcccdae0dc9d5d3932e8b7911351e928ab712a3c0cea745", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "## Characterization of the size of the two-photon excitation spot\n\nThe lateral (xy) size of the two-photon excitation spot was measured with a fluorescent microscope slide, and the axial (z) size was measured using 0.2-nm fluorescent beads (Suncoast Yellow, Bangs Laboratories), by scanning the z-position of the optogenetic spot while maintaining the imaging focal plane fixed (Extended Data Fig. 2a).\n\nWe further tested our targeted stimulation in two ways: selective photobleaching and neuronal activation. First, we targeted individual neurons at various depths in the worm's brain, and we illuminated them with the pulsed laser to induce selective photobleaching of tagRFP-T. Extended Data Fig. 2c,d shows how our two-photon excitation spot selectively targets individual neurons, because it photobleaches tagRFP-T only in the neuron that we decide to target, and not in nearby neurons. To faithfully characterize the spot size, we set the laser power such that the two-photon interaction probability profile of the excitation spot would not saturate the two-photon absorption probability of tagRFP-T. Second, we showed that our excitation spot is restricted along the z-axis by targeting a neuron and observing its calcium activity. When the excitation was directed at the neuron but shifted by 4 \u03bcm along z, the neuron showed no activation. By contrast, the neuron showed activation when the spot was correctly positioned on the neuron (Extended Data Fig. 2e). To further show that our stimulation is spatially restricted to an individual neuron more broadly throughout our measurements, we show that stimulations do not elicit responses in most of the close neighbours of the targeted neurons (Extended Data Fig. 2i and Supplementary Information).\n\n## Inclusion criteria\n\nStimulation events were included for further analysis if they evoked a detectable calcium response in the stimulated neuron (autoresponse). A classifier determined whether the response was detected by inspecting whether the amplitude of both the \u0394F/F0 transient and its second derivative exceeded a pair of thresholds. The same threshold values were applied to every animal, strain, neuron and stimulation event, and were originally set to match the human perception of a response above noise. Stimulation events that did not meet both thresholds for a contiguous 4 s were excluded. The RID responses shown in Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 7c are an exception to this policy. RID is visible on the basis of its CyOFP expression, but its tagRFP-T expression is too dim to consistently extract calcium signals. Therefore, in Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 7c (but not in other figures, such as Fig. 2), downstream neurons' responses to RID stimulation were included even in cases in which it was not possible to extract a calcium-activity trace in RID.\n\nNeuron traces were excluded from analysis if a human was unable to assign an identity or if the imaging time points were absent in a contiguous segment longer than 5% of the response window owing to imaging artefacts or tracking errors. A different policy applies to dim neurons of interest that are not automatically detected by the pseudo-segmentation algorithm in the 3D image used as reference for the point-set registration algorithm. In those cases, we manually added the position of those neurons to the reference 3D image. If these 'added' neurons are automatically detected in most of the other 3D images, then a calcium activity trace can be successfully produced by the DSMM nonrigid registration algorithm, and is treated as any other trace. However, if the 'added' neurons are too dim to be detected also in the other 3D images and the calcium activity trace cannot be formed for more than 50% of the total time points, the activity trace for those neurons is extracted from the neuron's position as determined from the position of neighbouring neurons. In the analysis code, we refer to these as 'matchless' traces, because the reference neuron is not matched to any detected neuron in the specific 3D image, but its position is just transformed according to the DSMM nonrigid deformation field. In this way, we are able to recover the calcium activity of some neurons whose tagRFP-T expression is otherwise too dim to be reliably detected by the pseudo-segmentation algorithm. Responses to RID stimulation shown in Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 7c are an exception to this policy.

If the downstream neuron did not show a response, we considered the downstream response to be below the noise level and the kernel to be zero.\n\n## Statistical analysis\n\nWe used two statistical tests to identify neuron pairs that under our stimulation and imaging conditions can be deemed 'functionally connected', 'functionally non-connected' or for which we lack the confidence to make either determination. Both tests compare observed calcium transients in each downstream neuron to a null distribution of transients recorded in experiments lacking stimulation.\n\nTo determine whether a pair of neurons can be deemed functionally connected, we calculated the probability of observing the measured calcium response in the downstream neuron given no neural stimulation. We used a two-sided Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test to compare the distributions of the downstream neuron's \u0394F/F\u2080 amplitude and its temporal second derivative from all observations of that neuron pair under stimulation to the empirical null distributions taken from control recordings lacking stimulation. P values were calculated separately for \u0394F/F\u2080 and its temporal second derivative, and then combined using Fischer's method to report a single fused P value for each neuron pair. Finally, to account for the large number of hypotheses tested, a false discovery rate was estimated. From the list of P values, each neuron was assigned a q value using the Storey\u2013Tibshirani method\u2074\u2070. q values are interpreted as follows: when considering an ensemble of putative functional connections of q values all less than or equal to q\u2080, an approximately q\u2080 fraction of those connections would have appeared in a recording that lacked any stimulation.\n\nTo explicitly test whether a pair of neurons are functionally not connected, taking into account the amplitude of the response, their reliability, the number of observations and multiple hypotheses, we also computed equivalence P_eq and q_eq values. This assesses the confidence of a pair not being connected. We test whether our response is equivalent to what we would expect from our control distribution using the two one-sided t-test (TOST)\u2077\u00b2. We computed P_eq values for \u0394F/F\u2080 and its temporal second derivative for a given pair being equivalent to the control distributions within an \u03b5 = 1.2 \u03c3_\u0394F/F\u2080,\u2202\u00b2t. Here, \u03c3_\u0394F/F\u2080,\u2202\u00b2t is the standard deviation of the corresponding control distribution. We then combined the two P_eq values into a single one with the Fisher method and computed q_eq values using the Storey\u2013Tibshirani method\u2074\u2070. Note that, different from the regular P values described above, the equivalence test relies on the arbitrary choice of \u03b5, which defines when we call two distributions equivalent. We chose a conservative value of \u03b5 = 1.2\u03c3.\n\nWe note that the statistical framework is stringent and a large fraction of measured neuron pairs fail to pass either statistical test.\n\n## Measuring path length through the synaptic network\n\nTo find the minimum path length between neurons in the anatomical network topology, we proceeded iteratively. We started from the original binary connectome and computed the map of strictly two-hop connections by looking for pairs of neurons that are not connected in the starting connectome (the actual anatomical connectome at the first step) but that are connected through a single intermediate neuron.

Note that this is a permissive description of anatomical connections, as it considers even neurons with only a single synaptic contact in only one individual to be connected.\n\n## Fitting kernels\n\nKernels k_ij(t) were defined as the functions to be convolved with the activity \u0394F_i of the stimulated neuron to obtain the activity \u0394F_j of a responding neuron i, such that \u0394F_j(t) = (k_ij * \u0394F_i)(t). To fit kernels, each kernel k(t) was parametrized as a sum of convolutions of decaying exponentials\n\n$$k(t) = \\sum_m c_m(\u03b8(t)e^{-\u03b3_{m,0}t}) * \u03b8(t)e^{-\u03b3_{m,1}t} * \\ldots,$$\n\nwhere the indices i, j are omitted for clarity and \u03b8 is the Heaviside function. This parametrization is exact for linear systems, and works as a description of causal signal transmission also in nonlinear systems. Note that increasing the number of terms in the successive convolutions does not lead to overfitting, as would occur by increasing the degree of a polynomial. Overfitting could occur by increasing the number of terms in the sum, which in our fitting is constrained to be a maximum of 2. The presence of two terms in the sum allows the kernels to represent signal transmission with saturation (with c\u2080 and c\u2081 of opposite signs) and assume a fractional-derivative-like shape.\n\nThe convolutions are performed symbolically. The construction of kernels as in equation (1) starts from a symbolically stored, normalized decaying exponential kernel with a factor A_\u03b3,0 \u03b8(t)e^(-\u03b3\u2080t). Convolutions with normalized exponentials \u03b3_n \u03b8(t)e^(-\u03b3_n t) are performed sequentially and symbolically, taking advantage of the fact that successive convolutions of exponentials always produce a sum of functions in the form \u221d \u03b8(t)t^n e^(-\u03b3t). Once rules are found to convolve an additional exponential with a function in that form, any number of successive convolution can be performed. These rules are as follows:\n\n1.

The activity of the stimulated neuron can be either the experimentally observed activity or an arbitrarily shaped activity introduced for the purposes of simulation.\n\nTo compute kernel-derived neural activity correlations (Fig. 6), we completed the following steps. (1) We computed the responses of all the neurons i to the stimulation of a neuron j chosen to drive activity in the network. To compute the responses, for each pair i, j, we used the kernel (ki,j(t))trials averaged over multiple trials. For kernel-based analysis, pairs with connections of q > 0.05 were considered not connected. We set the activity \u0394Fj(t) in the driving neuron to mimic an empirically observed representative activity transient. (2) We computed the correlation coefficient of the resulting activities. (3) We repeated steps 1 and 2 for a set of driving neurons (all or top-n neurons, as in Fig. 6). (4) For each pair k, l, we took the average of the correlations obtained by driving the set of neurons j in step 3.\n\n## Anatomy-derived simulations of activity\n\nAnatomy-derived simulations were performed as described previously47. In brief, this simulation approach uses differential equations to model signal transmission through electrical and chemical synapses and includes a nonlinear equation for synaptic activation variables. We injected current in silico into individual neurons and simulated the responses of all the other neurons. Anatomy-derived responses (Fig. 3) of the connection from neuron j to neuron i were computed as the peak of the response of neuron i to the stimulation of j. Anatomy-based predictions of spontaneous correlations in Fig. 6 were calculated analogously to kernel-based predictions.\n\nIn one analysis in Fig. 3d, the synapse weights and polarities were allowed to float and were fitted from the functional measurements. In all other cases, synapse weights were taken as the scaled average of three adult connectomes1,6 and an L4 connectome6, and polarities were assigned on the basis of a gene-expression analysis of ligand-gated ionotropic synaptic connections that considered glutamate, acetylcholine and GABA neurotransmitter and receptor expression, as performed in a previous study37 and taken from CeNGEN38 and other sources. Specifically, we used a previously published dataset (S1 data in ref. 37) and aggregated polarities across all members of a cellular subtype (for example, polarities from source AVAL and AVAR were combined). In cases of ambiguous polarities, connections were assumed to be excitatory, as in the previous study37. For other biophysical parameters we chose values commonly used in C. elegans modelling efforts9,30,47,73.\n\n## Characterizing stereotypy of functional connections\n\nTo characterize the stereotypy of a neuron pair's functional connection, its kernels were inspected. A kernel was calculated for every stimulus-response event in which both the upstream and downstream neuron exhibited activity that exceeded a threshold. At least two stimulus-response events that exceeded this threshold were required to calculate their stereotypy. The general strategy for calculating stereotypy was to convolve different kernels with the same stimulus inputs and compare the resulting outputs. The similarity of two outputs is reported as a Pearson's correlation coefficient. Kernels corresponding to different stimulus-response events of the same pair of neurons were compared with one another round-robin style, one round-robin each for a given input stimulus. For inputs we chose the set of all stimuli delivered to the upstream neuron. The neuron-pairs stereotypy is reported as the average Pearson's correlation coefficient across all round-robin kernel pairings and across all stimuli.\n\n## Rise time of kernels\n\nThe rise time of kernels, shown in Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 6d, was defined as the interval between the earliest time at which the value of the kernel was 1/e its peak value and the time of its peak (whether positive or negative). The rise time was zero if the peak of the kernel was at time t = 0. However, saturation of the signal transmission can make kernels appear slower than the connection actually is. For example, the simplest instantaneous connection would be represented by a single decaying exponential in equation (1), which would have its peak at time t = 0. However, if that connection is saturating, a second, opposite-sign term in the sum is needed to fit the kernel. This second term would make the kernel have a later peak, thereby masking the instantaneous nature of the connection.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4645, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "52e42bfd-e2a0-463e-a565-3abc11202bf3": {"__data__": {"id_": "52e42bfd-e2a0-463e-a565-3abc11202bf3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "adc3c488-197b-446a-8cc8-c42ed4c12d85", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "6f74011191ea3b2e1d5dc3b390f6b6234f62505f91019942bcdff2d21a183c98", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a6a0aa32-ceaf-4c5c-a163-51dea7ec2d12", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 14](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "e3055e530dda6170b7f392f01d2e148b4e91fac87153a9bf578fb447407be75a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "## Rise time of kernels\n\nThe rise time of kernels, shown in Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 6d, was defined as the interval between the earliest time at which the value of the kernel was 1/e its peak value and the time of its peak (whether positive or negative).

We list these connections and provide additional examples in Extended Data Fig. 9.\n\nUsing a recent neuropeptide-GPCR interaction screen in C. elegans52 and gene-expression data from CeNGEN38, we find putative combinations of neuropeptides and GPCRs that can mediate those connections (Supplementary Table 1). We produced such a list of neuropeptide and GPCR combinations using the Python package Worm Neuro Atlas (https://github.com/francescorandi/wormneuroatlas). In the list, we only include transcripts from CeNGEN detected with the highest confidence (threshold 4), as described previously51. For each neuron pair, we first searched the CeNGEN database for neuropeptides expressed in the upstream neuron, then identified potential GPCR targets for each neuropeptide using information from previous reports52,74, and finally went back to the CeNGEN database to find whether the downstream neuron in the pair was among the neurons expressing the specific GPCRs. The existence of potential combinations of neuropeptide and GPCR putatively mediating signalling supports our observation that communication in the candidate neuron pairs that we identify can indeed be mediated extrasynaptically through neuropeptidergic machinery.\n\n## Reporting summary\n\nFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n\n## Data availability\n\nMachine-readable datasets containing the measurements from this work are publicly accessible through on Open Science Foundation repository at https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/E2SYT.

Imaging excitation wavelength and intensity were chosen to avoid GUR-3/PRDX-2 activation. GCaMP response to 500 nm activation of GUR-3/PRDX-2 expressing neuron as reported in24. Vertical grey line indicates light intensity typically used for calcium imaging in present work. Inset: GCaMP6 excitation spectra from26. Vertical cyan line indicates 505-nm imaging excitation wavelength used in present work. c,d, A neuron near (c) and a neuron far (d) from the objective are photobleached to demonstrate targeted illumination. tagRFP-T is photobleached by 2p stim (20 s illumination, 200 \u03bcW, 500 kHz repetition rate, 3.1 \u03bcm diameter FWHM spot). Difference image shows tagRFP-T fluorescence merged with a false-colour blue-green image to reveal change in intensity after targeted illumination. Only targeted neuron and not nearby neurons appear photobleached. Insets shows zoomed-in image of the targeted neuron's original tagRFP-T intensity (left) and difference image (right). Laser power was chosen to avoid saturated bleaching. For a sense of scale, C. elegans interneuron cell somas are roughly 4 microns in diameter. e, In vivo demonstration of 2p effective spot size. Activity from a neuron expressing GUR-3/PRDX-2 and GCaMP6s is shown in response to a 300-ms 2p stimulation delivered at t = 11 s, 4 \u03bcm beyond the \u2248 3.5 \u03bcm diameter soma on the optical axis (z), and at t = 35 s, centred on the soma (t = 35 s). Only on-target soma stimulation evokes a transient, called an \"autoresponse\". A stimulus artefact at t = 35 s is visible because no smoothing or filtering is applied to this trace.

We recorded from >113 individual WT-background animals and performed over 20,000 pairwise\n                  stimulus response measurements. Sample size was chosen to be many fold larger than typical C. elegans calcium imaging experiments in the\n                  field, e.g. Hallinen et al., elife 2021.\n\nData exclusions   Inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in the \"Inclusion criteria\" subsection of the Methods, and pasted here:\n                  Stimulation events were included for further analysis if they evoked a detectable calcium response in the stimulated neuron (autoresponse). A\n                  classifier determined whether the response was detected by inspecting whether the amplitude of both the DF/F transient and its second\n                  derivative exceeded a pair of thresholds. The same threshold values were applied to every animal, strain, neuron and stimulation event, and\n                  were originally set to match human perception of a response above noise. Stimulation events that did not meet both thresholds for a\n                  contiguous 4 seconds were excluded. RID responses shown in Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 7c are an exception to this policy. RID is visible\n                  based on its CyOFP expression, but its tagRFP-T expression is too dim to consistently extract calcium signals. Therefore in Fig. 4 and Extended\n                  Data Fig. 7c (but not in other figures, like Fig. 2) responses to RID stimulation were included even in cases where it was not possible to extract\n                  a calcium-activity trace in RID.\n\n                  Neuron traces were excluded from analysis if a human was unable to assign an identity or if the imaging time points were absent in a\n                  contiguous segment longer than 5% of the response window due to imaging artifacts or tracking errors. A different policy applies to dim\n                  neurons of interest that are not automatically detected by the \"pseudo\"-segmentation algorithm in the 3D image used as reference for the\n                  pointset registration algorithm. In those cases, we manually added the position of those neurons to the reference 3D image. If these \"added\"\n                  neurons are automatically detected in most of the other 3D images, then a calcium activity trace can be successfully produced by the DSMM\n                  nonrigid registration algorithm and is treated as any other trace. However, if the \"added\" neurons are too dim to be detected also in the\n                  other 3D images and the calcium activity trace cannot be formed for more than 50% of the total time points, the activity trace for those\n                  neurons is extracted from the neuron's position as determined from the position of neighboring neurons. In the analysis code, we refer to\n                  these as \"matchless\" traces, because the reference neuron is not matched to any detected neuron in the specific 3D image, but its position is\n                  just transformed according to the DSMM nonrigid deformation field.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4906, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "231c8c59-7a9a-44b8-8d59-0bc280c242f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "231c8c59-7a9a-44b8-8d59-0bc280c242f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 27](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8388ce74-5241-42df-99f0-f4cf3fe08f03", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 27](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "7735235b9e3185f724f888a8110fc09875e4270f52c6b4c31bbf2357cd6685de", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5f439a7d-c724-4310-aea4-5a7f212e4b41", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Randi_et_al_2023, Section Page 27](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06683-4)"}, "hash": "ed18a9a4e7aa5aa38a065f516640454b2dbf8edc2e3db6a7fd0973b7388abaec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "In those cases, we manually added the position of those neurons to the reference 3D image.

Direct intercellular connections between the alimentary tissues and the rest of the body are minimal. Topologically, this system forms a separate epithelial tube running inside the cylindrical body wall, separated from it by the pseudocoelomic space, and placed parallel to the gonad. At the anteriormost end, the pharyngeal epithelium connects to the arcade cells of the lips (See Interfacial Epithelial Cells). The posteriormost region of the alimentary tract, the rectal epithelium and anus, is surrounded by the tail hypodermis and the dorsorectal ganglion. One pair of somatic neurons (RIPL/RIPR) penetrates the pharyngeal basal lamina to make gap junctions with a pair of pharyngeal neurons (I1L/R). Otherwise the only connection that spans the two systems (somatic vs. enteric) are the four specialized enteric muscle cells that act on the intestine and rectal valve while being driven by the somatic motor neurons, AVL and DVB.\n\nThe alimentary system is divided into the foregut (stomodeum; buccal cavity and the pharynx), the midgut (intestine), and the hindgut (proctodeum; rectum and anus in hermaphrodites and cloaca in males) and  contains a total of 127 cells (AlimFIG 1). The stomodeum and proctodeum are lined with cuticle, which is shed along with body cuticle during molts (See Cuticle) (Bird and Bird, 1991). The stomodeum and proctodeum are also regions into which enteric glands open; pharyngeal glands open to the stomodeum and rectal glands open to the proctodeum. Ingested material flows through the digestive tract by the muscular pumping and peristalsis of the pharynx at the anterior end, and the waste material is discarded through the opening of the anus at the posterior end by the action of the enteric muscles. The intestine itself is devoid of any muscular structure in C. elegans, although its rear portion can be contracted by the stomatointestinal (SI) muscles (see Intestine). During defecation, the body wall muscles also contribute to the control of internal pressure and concentration of the gut contents before the expulsion of the waste material (see Rectum and Anus).

Four coelomocytes are present at hatching and two are generated in the first larval stage. Because there is evidence for absorption and concentration of soluble materials by coelomocytes of various nematode species, these cells were suggested to be phagocytic and similar in function to the macrophages of vertebrates (Chitwood and Chitwood, 1950). In larger nematode species, such as Ascaris suum, the coelomocytes can indeed phagocytose invading organisms (Bolla et al., 1972). Their inclusions and vesicles stain easily with dyes such as Methylene blue, Neutral red and Neutral violet, and these dyes sometimes appear to collect in high concentrations. Similarly, because of their ability to continuously endocytose and accumulate a variety of macromolecules from the body cavity fluid, coelomocytes of C. elegans have been suggested to serve immune, scavenging and hepatic functions (Fares and Grant, 2002; Yanowitz and Fire, 2005). Unlike macrophages of higher organisms, however, coelomocytes of C. elegans do not seem to be capable of phagocytosis (Ewbank, 2002). Also, they are not actively migratory and their position in the body cavity is relatively fixed, possibly by attachments to the body wall. As a result, coelomocytes rely on both the movements of the animal and the body cavity fluid for accessing foreign material.\n\nLike the intestine and gonad, coelomocyte positioning reveals dextral handedness of the animal grown at 20\u00b0C; the ventral anterior pair is located on the right side and close to the pharynx, and the ventral posterior pair is on the left side and anterior to the vulva. When animals are cultivated at 10\u00b0C, this handedness may become reversed such that 0.5% of animals shows sinistral handedness instead of dextral (Wood et al., 1996).

The right ventral (ventral anterior; ccAR and ccPR) and the left ventral (ventral posterior; ccAL and ccPL) pairs are derived from MS granddaughters MSpp and MSap, respectively (CcFIG 2 and CcFIG 3). They are generated from symmetrical divisions late in embryogenesis, when most of the other embryonic cell divisions have been completed (Sulston et al., 1983). Although the mother cell for each pair is born during the large burst of embryonic cell divisions, they remain arrested for a couple of hours before final cell division and differentiation. During this arrest in cell division before the elongation of the embryo, the two mother cells migrate posteriorly from the head where there are born, giving rise to the specific localizations of their daughter pairs of coelomocytes (CcFIG 2) (Hedgecock et al., 1987). \n\n\n\nThe MS lineage also gives rise to the M mesoblast, which is responsible for all nongonadal mesoderm formation during post-embryonic development, including the two dorsal coelomocytes (ccDR and ccDL). The M mesoblast is born on the left side of the embryo next to the pharynx and then migrates to the posterior of the animal, following a ventral path between the two germ-line progenitors Z2 and Z3. It lingers on the midline for some time, but eventually moves to the right-hand side of the intestine and attaches to the body wall over QV5 (CcFIG 2 and CcFIG 4) (Sulston et al., 1983). Here, several consecutive divisions give rise to 18 cells by the L1 molt. Of these cells, 14 become body wall (striated) muscles, 2 become sex (nonstriated) muscle progenitor cells, and 2 dorsal cells (Mdlpa and Mdrpa) differentiate into coelomocytes during the L2 stage. In males, the M lineage gives rise to a single dorsal coelomocyte so that the total number of coelomocytes in males is five instead of six. Also in L1 males, one of the ventral left-side coelomocytes is located posterior to the gonad primordium rather than anteriorly, as in L1 hermaphrodite (see Introduction to Male Anatomy - Anatomical differences between sexes; Sulston and Horvitz, 1977).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2174, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "396cea99-4110-4ca6-9893-b3f2dcfed66c": {"__data__": {"id_": "396cea99-4110-4ca6-9893-b3f2dcfed66c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Coelomocyte System, Section 3) Structure and Function](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/coelomocyte/Coelomoframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "84775e66-4ca9-414b-b7d6-49fc25145912", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Coelomocyte System, Section 3) Structure and Function](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/coelomocyte/Coelomoframeset.html)"}, "hash": "31c9e6dbcca6d4f1f10963b66f1e1d198b034840ad03edda571d03e02281449d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "While coelomocytes in C. elegans  are ovoid in shape, they can adopt stellate shapes in some other species. Each coelomocyte is about 10-15 \u03bcm in diameter and its cytoplasm contains a distended rough endoplasmic reticulum and many membrane-bound vesicles of various sizes ( CcFIG 5 ) ( Fares and Greenwald, 2001 ). When viewed by DIC optics, the cells are distinctive in that they contain both pale vacuoles and highly refractile inclusions ( Sulston and Horvitz, 1977 ). Each cell is covered by its own basal lamina. Some portions of the plasma membrane show active endocytosis, with multiple, approximately 0.1 \u03bcm endocytic invaginations lying in close proximity to one another ( CcFIG 5 ). Foreign substances such as India ink, rhodamine-dextran, GFP, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-BSA and FITC-lipopolysaccharide of S. typhimurium, that are injected into the body cavity of C. elegans are rapidly taken up by coelomocytes ( Fares and Greenwald, 2001 , Zhang, et al., 2001 ). Although they do not normally take up yolk particles from the pseudocoelom, coelomocytes can be induced to take up GFP-tagged yolk particles, apparently due to the presence of the GFP moiety ( Paupard et al., 2001 ). \n\n\n\nConsistent with their role in uptake, several proteins known to function in endocytosis in other organisms are active in C. elegans coelomocytes (Fares and Greenwald, 2001). The fluid-phase markers that are taken up by coelomocytes travel through the endocytic (early and late) compartments and eventually reach lysosomes where they are degraded or stored if they are not amenable to digestion (Fares and Grant, 2002; Treusch et al., 2004). This active endocytosis by coelomocytes may function for scavenging as a primitive immune surveillance function. This function does not seem to be significant or essential for the animal's survival or fertility, however, because animals tolerate changes in the number of coelomocytes. Also, when coelomocytes are toxin-ablated, the treated animals continue to grow and bear progeny (Harfe et al., 1998; Fares and Greenwald, 2001; Yanowitz and Fire, 2005). Additionally, C. elegans seems to be susceptible to the intrapseudocoelomic injection of even small amounts of bacteria, which normally do not gain access to pseudocoelom due to three barriers: The grinder of the pharynx breaks down bacteria entering from the mouth; the multilayered cuticle envelops the body, acting a physical barrier; and a complex innate immune system that, at least in part, resembles that of higher organisms may function as a defense against bacterial infection (Millet and Ewbank 2004; Nicholas and Hodgkin 2004).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2639, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2be8f95-0001-4800-9720-7d8d8c6f2856": {"__data__": {"id_": "f2be8f95-0001-4800-9720-7d8d8c6f2856", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Coelomocyte System, Section 4) List of Coelomocytes](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/coelomocyte/Coelomoframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e3e14f1-a719-41a9-b7e4-36eb5c977743", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Coelomocyte System, Section 4) List of Coelomocytes](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/coelomocyte/Coelomoframeset.html)"}, "hash": "dfaa90b9f1d0497f2836e7a73b6e332125ba378ff023382491970708da76b0d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 0, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f4ed1f25-b583-4fb0-9888-74587487afc5": {"__data__": {"id_": "f4ed1f25-b583-4fb0-9888-74587487afc5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Coelomocyte System, Section 5) References](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/coelomocyte/Coelomoframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "96c0606a-fb43-4fb5-961f-01a283f6ad67", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Coelomocyte System, Section 5) References](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/coelomocyte/Coelomoframeset.html)"}, "hash": "fc8d80b1450029da7ae3f0e7446a1897b8f4b9d18fd162d80e5c6f02989a10be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Zhang, Y., Grant, B. and Hirsh, D. 2001.

The innexins are expressed in almost every cell and while they bear no specific sequence homologies to vertebrate connexins, they form intercellular membrane channels with similarities in structure and function to those in vertebrate tissues. There is distant homology between the innexin genes of C. elegans and the pannexin protein channels of vertebrates (Phelan and Starich, 2001; Baranova et al., 2004; Penuela et al., 2013). Caenorhabditis elegans utilizes gap junctions in different ways in virtually all of its cells (see reviews by: Liu et al., 2006; Bao et al., 2007; Norman and Villu Maricq, 2007; Altun et al., 2009; Simonsen et al., 2014). Here we present molecular information and developmental aspects of gap junction formation and additionally show how gap junctions function in the adult tissues, particularly within the nervous system and motor system. The use of multiple different subunits per channel make the nematodes utilization of gap junctions more sophisticated and complex than what is currently known for vertebrate systems. Physiological studies of nematode gap junctions have mostly been done prior to any knowledge of their complex subunit usage (Stretton et al., 1978; del Castillo et al, 1989), and beg to be redone with consideration of this variable (White, 2003; Liu et al., 2013; Starich et al., 2014). There is still much more to be learned about how these same channel proteins might be utilized in hemichannels rather than as intercellular junctions.\n\nThe following chapter combines the content of two recent reviews on gap junctions (Hall, 2016 and Hall, 2017).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1735, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc3aa74c-a60c-4725-bf62-301bc433c4cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc3aa74c-a60c-4725-bf62-301bc433c4cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 2) Expression and Structure](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e66b51b5-d8ba-459f-9f06-c99cc1000d89", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 2) Expression and Structure](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "hash": "545cd99f7a63c8edc9ad3a2b01a3b801c6052dd1b949718c7bdcf01bf8ce2b93", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0cd822a2-ba31-41fc-b4e3-0fe757c244d4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "17dcac1e3329ace246cd8d2dfc76c2e1c793234a20ec764c111f338fcefd5281", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Innexin genes in C. elegans show a similar diversity in number and organization to the connexin family in vertebrates, and are surprisingly numerous compared to some other invertebrates such as the fruit fly Drosophila or the planarian Dugesia. The C. elegans genome encodes 25 innexin genes, and virtually every cell type in the animal appears to express at least one innexin protein, often expressing multiple different innexin genes per cell (Altun et al., 2009). The multiplicity of innexin expression underlies the formation of heterotypic and heteromeric gap junctions, perhaps several types per cell (Liu et al., 2013; Starich et al., 2014). Heterotypic channels offer unique opportunities for developmental modulation of channel properties in a manner parallel to what is becoming well known for other forms of intercellular membrane channels, such as glutamate or NMDA receptors (Liu and Zukin, 2007; Rodenas-Ruano et al., 2012).\n\nAlthough gap junctions can appear essentially equivalent even at the ultrastructural level using standard electron microscopy (TEM) in thin sections, the junctions of invertebrate tissues stand apart from those in vertebrates when investigated by the freeze fracture (FF) technique (Staehelin, 1974; Lane et al., 1977). Vertebrate gap junction channels appear to be grouped into well-ordered clusters of intramembrane particles (IMPs), with six-fold symmetry reflecting their internal composition of six subunits per hemichannel. Invertebrate gap junctions often show larger IMPS and some may utilize more subunits per hemichannel (GapjunctFIG 1A). INX-6 channels in the C. elegans intestine involve 8 subunits per hemichannel rather than 6, forming larger IMPs and probably a wider channel pore size (Oshima et al., 2013, 2016) (GapjunctFIG 1B). Oshima et al. (2016) argue that since many invertebrate gap junctions feature relatively large IMPs when viewed by FF, this 8-fold arrangement may be commonplace for innexin-based channels.\n\nVertebrate gap junctions always consist of IMPs cleaving to the 'P-face' of the plasma membrane replica, with corresponding 'E-face' pits seen in a matching pattern to the IMPs. However, invertebrate gap junctions often consist of mixtures of particles and pits in both replica faces, sometimes with most IMPs cleaving to the E-face (Lane et al., 1977) (GapjunctFIG 2A&B). The planarian Dugesia was the first invertebrate where it became clear that individual tissues could show unique patterns in this E-face/P-face distribution when compared by FF (Quick and Johnson, 1977).\u00a0 Early FF results in C. elegans revealed a similar diversity (Hall, 1987). Although the IMPs in many nematode tissues appear to show similar diameters and similar packing densities, the ratio of E-face to P-face particles is tissue specific and the number of IMPs per array varies widely (GapjunctTABLE 1).\n\nGiven the small size of nematode cells, most IMP arrays are necessarily relatively small. Some classes of gap junctions in C. elegans are so small in size that they can only be revealed by the FF technique, but are never large enough to be seen in TEM by thin section (Starich et al., 2014). The small size of neuronal gap junctions in C. elegans has been a major concern in trying to describe the full connectome of the nematode nervous system (Hall, 1977; White et al., 1986; Hall and Russell, 1991; Jarrell et al., 2012). Another high resolution method for discovering these arrays of IMPs uses infiltration by lanthanum salts (GapjunctFIG 2C,D). Lanthanum infiltration permits one to see the arrays of channels by negative staining, where electron dense lanthanum penetrates the narrow space between opposing plasma membranes at a gap junction, but is excluded by the channels themselves, as those channel subunits project all the way across that intercellular space (Revel and Karnovsky, 1967).\n\nCareful anatomical studies of the entire adult of both sexes have revealed that gap junctions can be seen in virtually all tissue types, and in almost every cell in C. elegans (Hall and Altun, 2008).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4063, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0cd822a2-ba31-41fc-b4e3-0fe757c244d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "0cd822a2-ba31-41fc-b4e3-0fe757c244d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 2) Expression and Structure](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e66b51b5-d8ba-459f-9f06-c99cc1000d89", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 2) Expression and Structure](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "hash": "545cd99f7a63c8edc9ad3a2b01a3b801c6052dd1b949718c7bdcf01bf8ce2b93", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bc3aa74c-a60c-4725-bf62-301bc433c4cf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 2) Expression and Structure](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "hash": "9451f9d3c96e4f8d0e364d62c9abf248bfded00ba4318c84bd59d0fef51410e8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Another high resolution method for discovering these arrays of IMPs uses infiltration by lanthanum salts (GapjunctFIG 2C,D).

In some larval tissues, gap junctions are seen early in development, only to disappear when groups of epithelial cells fuse to form larger syncytia in the adult (Nguyen et al., 1999). Large gap junctions can allow transfer of fluid, ions or small molecules between dissimilar cell, as in the excretory system (Hall, 2016; Hall and Altun, 2008). When viewed globally across C. elegans tissues, the pattern of innexin expression across neighboring cells suggests that heteromeric and heterotypic gap junction channels will be common in C. elegans (Altun et al, 2009).\n\nThe amino acid sequences of the innexins of C. elegans (and other invertebrates) do not resemble the sequences of gap junction proteins of vertebrates, known as 'connexins'. However they do share overall similarity with the 'pannexins' of the vertebrate world (Baranova et al., 2003). The human genome includes 3 different pannexin genes, none of which seems to form true gap junctions (Chiu et al, 2014; Retamal and Saez, 2014). However, pannexins have been implicated in acting as membrane ion channels that do not link to similar channels in an opposing membrane, but instead act as 'hemichannels' (Bruzzone et al, 2003; Sosinsky et al, 2011; Retamal and Saez, 2014). Such hemichannels are proving important in a variety of human diseases, including inflammation, ischemia and tumor genesis (Chiu et al, 2014).\n\nHemichannels in vertebrates can sometimes function as stretch receptors (Richter et al., 2014). The nematode innexin unc-7 can also act as a hemichannel in several different sensory neurons, including the touch cells (ALM, PLM, etc) and in the harsh touch cells (PVD), and in both instances the unc-7 hemichannel acts as a receptor either for gentle touch, harsh touch, or both (Walker and Schafer, 2020). An earlier report by Bouhours et al (2011) had previously demonstrated that unc-7 may also act as a hemichannel at neuromuscular junctions in C. elegans. Remarkably, when the human pannexin 1 sequence is used to replace UNC-7 protein in the touch neurons of an mutant, pannexin1 hemichannels can rescue touch sensitivity in ALM and PLM (Walker and Schafer, 2020).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3388, "end_char_idx": 6215, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a79451cb-8fcb-43ae-bdc4-e94aa45d4b8a": {"__data__": {"id_": "a79451cb-8fcb-43ae-bdc4-e94aa45d4b8a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 3) Development](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ffdf16dd-55ea-4914-9048-b3418b9298f0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 3) Development](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "hash": "a8639e4bc2752600e5db0e33f3a3b7ee5d2c92bf02ccf7d4e426ddf3054dfc71", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "53a99197-5f9e-4d82-a459-1fbd5558f7a3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "280f2fdf7d806b3e0eb8dc6ffd4f006c388c6515052560d5104926beab62fac5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The roles that gap junctions play in tissue development may be diverse, but few innexin mutants have proven to be lethal, although some alleles do produce low levels of dead embryos. For instance, inx-3 mutant alleles yield occasional dead embryos in which the pharynx becomes detached from the intestine, apparently due to the weakening of tissue linkages at the pharyngeal valve (Starich et al., 2003). Indeed, INX-3 protein is expressed everywhere in the early embryo, and can be detected in small plaques ubiquitously even before the embryo begins gastrulation. It appears that at this early stage, all cells may be communicating with neighbors via gap junctions, at or near the time when these cells are undergoing 'global cell sorting' to migrate from the place of their birth to form functional groupings before tissues begin to form (Bischoff and Schnabel, 2006). Sister cells often have different fates, and some individual cells always undergo apoptosis. For development to progress, many cells must separate from their sisters after cell division and migrate to locate their proper partners before tissue morphogenesis can begin. Although unproven, it seems reasonable that gap junctions may play an accessory role in intercellular communication among undifferentiated cells to foster cell sorting, or to enhance cell clustering at the outset of morphogenesis. Stronger coupling might then help to synchronize or coordinate the morphogenesis within cell groups. Alternately, gap junctions may play an adhesive role during cell motility at this early stage in embryogenesis.\n\nCoincident with the early wave of INX-3 expression, INX-8 and INX-9 expression in the early embryo is associated with proper maturation of the eggshell (Starich et al., 2014; Stein and Golden, 2015). Mutations in either gene lead to leaky eggshells that permit diffusion of DAPI into the early embryo, with defects noted as early as the 4-cell stage. Other early defects in these mutants include failures in cytokinesis during early cell divisions, and the extrusion of polar bodies just beneath the eggshell.\n\nAs tissue development proceeds, virtually all cell types express one or more innexins, and gap junctions have been detected anatomically at the borders of most epithelial cells where they contact their neighbors within an epithelium (GapjunctFIG 3). As the early embryonic pharynx defect in inx-3 mutants suggests, gap junctions may also play a structural role in tissue integrity by linking one tissue to its neighbor, although adherens junctions are also widely utilized in the same role (Koeppen et al., 2001). GapjunctFIG 3C shows an example from the adult pharynx where an adherens junction and a gap junction lie side by side to help in attaching muscle and support cells tightly together. The nematode body plan involves many syncytial epithelia, and gap junctions have been seen by TEM along cell borders in advance of targeted cell fusions (including self-fusions) both in the embryonic excretory system (Stone et al., 2009; Abdus-Saboor et al., 2011; Mancuso et al., 2012), and in hypodermal cells in the late larval male tail (Nguyen et al., 1999). Thus, communication across gap junctions may help to guide certain steps in tissue morphogenesis.\n\nTransitory gap junctions have been shown to occur between developing neurons at a time when they are choosing between alternate cell fates (Chuang et al., 2007).\u00a0 The innexin gene nsy-5 is expressed in a cluster of neuron cell bodies in the lateral ganglion during late embryogenesis and early L1 stage, perhaps 12 neurons per side. Mutations in nsy-5 cause errors in the specification of the AWC neurons (AWCL and AWCR), where generally one cell chooses the AWC-ON cell fate while the opposite cell adopts an AWC-OFF fate. Gap junctions encoded by the nsy-5 innexin actually link multiple neurons in each lateral ganglion, including AWC, ASH and AFD during embryogenesis, but the AWC fate choice is the best described event requiring these intercellular junctions.

(For overview see Hermaphrodite Muscle System - Introduction.)\n\n GapjunctFIG 4: Gap junctions link muscle cells into functional units. A. Pharyngeal muscles fall into 8 segmental sets, pm1-pm8, with gap junctions ( red symbols ) linking neighboring segments to one another. Additional gap junctions link all muscles within a segment indirectly for pm2-pm7, via local gap junctions to marginal cells (not shown).

Three types of specialized (non-equivalent) muscles for defecation in hermaphrodite tail extend muscle arms to the surface of pre-anal ganglion (shown in pale red). White dotted circle indicates zone where overlapping muscle arms form gap junctions with one another, and receive neuromuscular junctions from motor axons.\n\nThe pharynx is responsible for the ingestion and preliminary processing of its main food source, small bacteria, by very rapid contractions of coordinated muscle groups that are well connected by gap junctions (see Hermaphrodite Alimentary System - Pharynx). Pharyngeal muscle groups lie in eight consecutive segments along the alimentary canal (GapjunctFIG 4A and GapjunctFIG 5). Muscles are linked within each set to all the other muscles in their segment via gap junctions to marginal cells (which separate muscles within each segment) (GapjunctFIG 3), and then linked again to muscles in the adjacent segment along the chain (Albertson and Thomson, 1976; Altun et al., 2009). These pharyngeal gap junctions underlie extremely fast radial contractions during feeding to sweep food items along the alimentary canal (Trojanowski et al., 2016). Virtually all pharyngeal muscle groups are organized in segmental fashion, and connected to their neighboring segments, including support cells, by a multiplicity of innexin channels (GapjunctFIG 5). Pharyngeal contractions are too rapid to be explained by chemical synaptic inputs from motor neurons, although pharyngeal neurons may influence the pharynx to change from one mode of action to the next (Raizen and Avery, 1994; Trojanowski and Fang-Yen, 2015). Instead, spontaneous contractility of the individual muscle types must drive the rate of action. It has been shown that virtually all pharyngeal neurons can be laser-ablated, individually or en masse, without abolishing the basal rhythm of muscle contraction (Avery and Horvitz, 1989).

Along the length of the pharynx, neighboring segmental groups express different assortments of innexins, so that heteromeric gap junctions between segments seem likely to be the rule here rather than the exception (GapjunctFIG 5).\n\nIn the bodywall muscles along the length of the animal, 95 muscles are grouped into four quadrants, with a double row of muscles lying within each quadrant, effectively creating 12 segments along the main body axis (Hall and Altun, 2008; Hermaphrodite Muscle System - Somatic Muscle). Spindle-shaped bodywall muscles extend sarcomeres along the bodywall, and also form unique thin extensions called 'muscle arms' to reach medially towards the 'muscle plate' (GapjunctFIG 4B&C) (White et al., 1976). These body muscles all express at least 6 innexins per cell, generally including the same set in all muscles for any stage in development (Liu et al., 2013). The cells are electrically coupled by gap junctions that are restricted to 'muscle arms' that extend from each cell towards either the dorsal or ventral motor nerve cord. Here each muscle arm is contacted by neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) from several categories of principal motor neurons (White et al., 1976; Liu et al., 2006; Hall and Altun, 2008). Where present, muscle arms also form prominent sets of gap junctions among themselves. Thus each muscle is linked to all its nearest neighbors on the dorsal side (or on the ventral side), including left/right dorsal or ventral pairings, but never reaching across the divide between dorsal and ventral quadrants (GapjunctFIG 4B&C). These gap junctions at muscle arms also link muscles 'segmentally' along the body to its anterior and posterior nearest neighbors.\u00a0 As a result, muscles lying with each muscle quadrant can conduct action potentials from head to tail or vice versa, depending on local activities that initiate a contractile wave in either the tail or the head to be passed along the body (White et al., 1976; Hall and Altun, 2008; Liu et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2011).\n\nAlthough the gap junctions along the major nerve cords represent the principal means to couple muscles in the four quadrants, there are additional gap junctions found between close neighbors within each muscle quadrant, both among the head muscles (GapjunctFIG 6B) and among bodywall muscles of the rest of the body (White et al., 1986; Qadota et al., 2017). These additional junctions occur on lateral cell membranes amidst the sarcomere regions. They cannot link L/R pairs, nor dorsal/ventral pairs, but only close neighbors within a row within one\u00a0 quadrant. Their relative importance in control of muscle contractions is not understood.\n\nThe layout of neuromuscular junction inputs to all bodywall muscle cells within a 'segment' should insure that all nearby cells on the ventral side (i.e. both ventral quadrants) of the body will act in synchrony, and antiphasic to all muscle cells within the corresponding segment on the dorsal side.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3626, "end_char_idx": 7457, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76c771ef-0068-4369-90e4-bac40a1bb756": {"__data__": {"id_": "76c771ef-0068-4369-90e4-bac40a1bb756", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 4.1) Muscle](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3d648aaf-1c1d-4809-912c-55b842ec3f35", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 4.1) Muscle](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "hash": "fb9376e8297c52c9c26f919903a65b12140dbcf6df6bd961357ec2014975f5b0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bf154cdb-e287-4b12-b67f-c0caa716debf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 4.1) Muscle](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "hash": "26f9def218b7018e66d6e9091807cc973c344551452f546aeb34a675660ca405", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3de60242-598e-4efd-b1fd-28ea231708ad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b49ebbd9c26f84bf61f3ecc8d784aecf87b4f200bf71c976b981405e2ed60bbb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "These additional junctions occur on lateral cell membranes amidst the sarcomere regions.

The neuromuscular junctions from a fascicle of motor axons are grouped near muscle arm branches in a manner at each motor nerve's 'muscle plate' where all muscles within the ventral segment may receive some fractional share of each quantal release of neurotransmitter at the muscle plate (Liu et al., 2006), and similar sharing of transmitter release occurs at the dorsal muscle plate for all dorsal bodywall muscles. While these multiplex neuromuscular junctions should help to keep all muscles in synchrony locally, there is perhaps a stronger input via electrical signaling among the converging muscle arms themselves. Moreover, since each muscle cell tends to have arms extending from the extreme ends of the full cell length, and because there is some overlap at these endpoints to muscles of the next 'segment', electrical signals should rapidly conduct within a quadrant from muscle to muscle along the length of the body to modulate contractility of the whole animal and its body shape. Genetic knockdown of any of six different innexin genes can partially inhibit this coupling, but there is no single innexin knockout that can fully extinguish coupling, as measured by intracellular recordings in a partially dissected preparation (Liu et al., 2013). Among these six innexins, the patterns of physiological deficits judged from such recordings suggest that there may be two different classes of heteromeric gap junctions here, one class involving two different innexins, and the second class involving four other innexins (GapjunctFIG 1B). \n\n 4.1.3 Head Muscles\n\nHead muscles use gap junctions to link all muscle cells in each of the four quadrants to one another within the quadrant, and via muscle arms extending near the anterior pharynx, contacting other muscle quadrants and the GLR support cells along the inner surface of the nerve ring (GapjunctFIG 6; Hermaphrodite Muscle System - GLR cells). GLRs are linked via gap junctions to each other, and also to a set of four RME motor neurons from the nerve ring. Importantly, the four muscle quadrants in the head can still operate somewhat independently from one another, so that the animal can control head motions in all directions, unlike the restricted range of motion possible for other bodywall muscles.\n\nGapjunctFIG 6: Muscle arms of the head muscles are linked by gap junctions.

Muscle arms from the 32 muscles in the head and neck project onto the inside surface of the nerve ring in a highly ordered fashion. Their terminal branches lie between the processes of GLR cells ( golden yellow ) on the inside and the motor neurons of the nerve ring ( dark red \u00a0and\u00a0 purple ) on the outside. Arms from the somatic head muscles run posteriorly until they reach the posterior nerve ring region. The arms from each muscle row then make an anterior arc of about 45' and extend inward to reach between the outside surface of the GLRs and the inner surface of the neural plate.

Somatic sheath cells are connected by gap junctions to their left/right homologues, and segmentally to other sheath cells along the length of the gonad (cf. SomaticFIG 6D) (Hall et al., 1999). Progressive waves of contraction by the sheath are thought to help push germ cells proximally, towards the spermatheca. The somatic sheath cells closest to the spermatheca also form large (transient) gap junctions to the primary oocyte, in the region closest to where the oocyte will be fertilized (cf. SomaticFIG 6C). The larger gap junctions connecting sheath cell 5 to the primary oocyte coordinate internal activities within the oocyte (seen as swirling motions by light microscopy). Rhythmic squeezing by sheath cell 5 forces the primary oocyte towards the spermatheca when it is ready for fertilization (Hall et al., 1999).\u00a0 Separately, sheath cells and the distal tip cell are each linked by hundreds of tiny gap junctions to the underlying germ cells (Starich et al., 2014). The smaller gap junctions between somatic gonad cells and developing germ cells help govern germ cell maturation (Starich et al., 2014). Gap junctions between all cells of the spermatheca help these cells to contract radially in unison to allow entry of the primary oocyte (cf. SomaticFIG 9EF) (Hall and Altun, 2008). But there are no synaptic connections between the nervous system and these muscular elements of the ovary.\n\n4.1.4.2 Vulva, Uterus and Male Sex Muscles\n\nSex-specific muscles of the hermaphrodite vulva and uterus are heavily linked by gap junctions, as are the specialized sex-specific muscles of the male tail (White et al., 1986; Sulston et al, 1980; Jarrell et al., 2012) (see Hermaphrodite Reproductive System - Egg-laying Apparatus and Male Muscle System - Male Specific Muscles). Thus, homologous muscles can operate coordinately, and related muscle groups can act sequentially, in quick succession. Some of these contractions can be vigorous and rapid, synchronized via gap junctions, acting much faster than ongoing neuronal patterns. A limited set of neuromuscular junctions link the hermaphrodite nervous system to a few members of the vulval muscles, and indirectly influence the uterine muscles via muscle-muscle gap junctions (cf. EggFIG 13) (White et al., 1986). Chemical neuromuscular junctions to the male tail's sex muscles are more elaborate, but gap junctions are extensive among all these sex muscles (cf. MaleMusFIG 30, 31 & 32).\n\n4.1.4.3 Defecation Muscles\n\nDefecation muscles in the tail operate in coordinated fashion to open the rectal valve and inflate the rectum during defecation (see Hermaphrodite Alimentary System - Rectum and Anus and Male Alimentary System - Defecation Muscles).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 10486, "end_char_idx": 14337, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f61281ab-a985-4d77-b60a-58ed062da38c": {"__data__": {"id_": "f61281ab-a985-4d77-b60a-58ed062da38c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 4.1) Muscle](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3d648aaf-1c1d-4809-912c-55b842ec3f35", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 4.1) Muscle](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "hash": "fb9376e8297c52c9c26f919903a65b12140dbcf6df6bd961357ec2014975f5b0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3de60242-598e-4efd-b1fd-28ea231708ad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 4.1) Muscle](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "hash": "c538617133b8151247a91931b8dba7bdcfa4630a6d6b9a732470bf6f81dea427", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "A limited set of neuromuscular junctions link the hermaphrodite nervous system to a few members of the vulval muscles, and indirectly influence the uterine muscles via muscle-muscle gap junctions (cf.

The somatic sheath cells and distal tip cell create a niche environment required for the development of the germline (Hall et al., 1999; Byrd et al., 2014; Starich et al., 2014) (see Hermaphrodite Reproductive System - Somatic Gonad and Reproductive System - Germline). Although larger gap junctions have been found between germline and soma in the proximal arm of the gonad (Hall et al., 1999), a new class of very small gap junctions has been discovered in the distal arm using freeze fracture (FF) and antibody staining. In the distal gonad arm, all individual junctions are too tiny to be discerned by standard TEM in thin sections (Starich et al., 2014). Some of these junctions connect the distal tip cell to the dividing germ cells at the distal end of the gonad arm, while similar small junctions connect the somatic sheath cells to the developing germline closer to the bend in the gonad arm (aka the 'reflex'). These gap junctions individually are composed of very small numbers of channels (IMPs per array seen by FF), but are collectively numerous where they connect germ cells to the overlying somatic gonad. Genetic knockdown of any one of five innexin genes leads to systematic defects in germ cell maturation, and the evidence suggests that a typical gap junction channel consists of two different innexin proteins in one hemichannel (on the germline side) and a different pair of innexin proteins in the opposite hemichannel (on the gonad sheath side) (GapjunctFIG 1D). The mixture of innexin usage differs gradually along the length of the gonad arm, so that a fifth innexin gradually substitutes at hemichannels at the opposite end of the extended chain of sheath cells. Communication via innexin channels here is necessary for the germline cells to switch from mitosis to meiosis as they move along within the gonad arm. Interestingly, since these individual germ cells each slowly move relative to the overlying gonad sheath, they must break and reform gap junctions continuously as they traverse the length of the gonad arm and around the bend towards the uterus. The same germ cells are also connected to nearby neighbors within the germline via a central syncytium, the acellular 'rachis' (Hall et al., 1999).\u00a0 This open door between all germ cells negates the chance that their gap junctions are allowing electrical signals to propagate, but to allow small molecules to be relayed between soma and germline. The dynamics of this situation are quite exciting, and much remains to be explored about how these gap junctions operate.\n\n4.3 Excretory Canal Epithelia Cells", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2766, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5033921-990f-4dda-be65-265d79e49c4a": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5033921-990f-4dda-be65-265d79e49c4a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 4.3) Excretory Canal Epithelia Cells](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "136a7a93-d42d-4936-a6a7-5ec41d1145ad", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 4.3) Excretory Canal Epithelia Cells](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "hash": "eb487096649e72dd5732b2988e847a47bf17e30b570b677c102fcc5846229bf8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Besides their roles in electrical signaling, gap junctions can permit the transfer of small molecules or fluid between tissues. This is well established for connexin-based junctions in vertebrates (Goldberg et al., 2004), but is not well established for many invertebrate innexin channels. The relatively large physical pore size of some innexin channels should favor passage of larger molecules and solutes (cf. Oshima et al., 2013, 2016). Although the permeability and gating of most innexin channels remains to be carefully explored, some prominent C. elegans gap junctions are already implicated in metabolic processes. For instance, the gap junctions between the excretory canal cell and the hypodermis are especially large and collectively occupy a substantial fraction of the membrane surface area where these two tissues meet (GapjunctFIG 3D) (Buechner et al., 1999; Hall and Altun, 2008). The canal cell extends lateral arms from its cell body to the far reaches of the head and tail, and operates as the kidney for C. elegans, removing excess fluid from the body and excreting this fluid through the excretory duct (see Hermaphrodite Excretory System). Deeply embedded into the surrounding hypodermis, the excretory canals collect fluids, potentially via their prominent gap junctions with the hypodermis.\u00a0 Those fluids are then filtered via the elaborate canaliculi from the canal cytoplasm into the luminal space within the extended canals, before export via the excretory duct. Mutations that disrupt the continuity of the excretory duct cause lethal consequences in the embryo and early L1 larval stage, due to a fluid buildup that swells the animal into a 'lethal rod' phenotype (Stone et al., 2009). Some mutant alleles in inx-12 and inx-13, the two main innexins expected to form the heterotypic junctions between hypodermis and the canal cell (Altun et al., 2009), also result in dead L1 larvae exhibiting lethal rod morphology (Todd Starich, pers. comm.). Although there are other possible explanations, these results suggest that INX-12/INX-13 junctions may facilitate water transport from hypodermis to canal cell.\n\nMany classes of epithelial cells with C. elegans are also linked to their nearest neighbors via gap junctions (Hall and Altun, 2008). Depending on the cell type, these junctions may be large or small, but many can be seen easily by TEM. This is true for hypodermis, intestine, and the anterior epithelial cells of the buccal cavity and pharynx, none of which is expected to electrically excitable. In each case, it seems more likely that cells within an epithelial compartment can exchange small molecules to like cells. The small gap junctions discussed above between soma and germline in the nematode gonad also seem to involve a metabolic relationship rather than electrical signaling. In the case of the intestine, a calcium wave is seen to pass along the chain of intestinal cells via homomeric INX-16 gap junctions that help to coordinate the defecation cycle (Peters et al., 2007). Additional innexins are also expressed by the intestinal cells that still permit dye coupling even in inx-16 mutants, but INX-16 alone seems to be required for normal propagation of calcium waves (Peters et al., 2007).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3244, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b08a7e5a-f286-4fe1-9629-ffede03f0116": {"__data__": {"id_": "b08a7e5a-f286-4fe1-9629-ffede03f0116", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 4.4) Nervous System](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2f23a5bf-8533-4fda-aec0-8705cc1be6d8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 4.4) Nervous System](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "hash": "82f2acfc1f0e0576fc3467f2bbc229c2baa9dd10368569fc028b8cea30a530af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8b99a48f-0bd1-47d2-adf9-0630a8362d22", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d84391ffec2ac0784c4f03b2bae728b8b81b1a5ac31efb8f21fb6e816376d0b3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Gap junctions within the nervous system connectome play diverse roles (see Hermaphrodite Nervous System). Sometimes they mimic connectivity patterns created by chemical synapses. But in other places, as in some muscles, gap junctions play a unique role in coupling arrays of cells, either to synchronize activities, or to provide a pathway to propagate signals independent from the chemical synapse network (Liu et al., 2011). Although there are only 302 neurons (see Individual Neurons for complete list) and 56 glia in the adult C. elegans hermaphrodite (White et al., 1986), the diversity of innexin expression within them is currently unmatched in any other model organism. Fully 20 of the 25 innexin genes have been shown to be expressed in one or more cells in the nervous system (Altun et al., 2009).\n\nSome innexins appear to be expressed in a very restricted set of cells. INX-14 is expressed only in the GABAergic inhibitory motor neuron classes, DD and VD. INX-5 is expressed mostly in glial cells, but in very few neurons. INX-2 is expressed only in AVK, and INX-1 only in AIB and briefly in AIY neurons. However, eight innexin genes are expressed in 15-30 neuron classes each. Furthermore, some neurons express groups of different innexins at once, and a few neurons may express as many as a dozen innexin genes.\n\nAs virtually all of the 302 neurons are expected to form gap junctions with other neurons, the issue of heteromeric and heterotypic channels arises immediately. Early hints for innexin mixtures were suggested from genetic studies of 'uncoordinated' animals, where single mutations of different innexin genes gave rise to no obvious phenotype, or to only mild or moderate dysfunction in neurons and muscles (Starich et al., 1996). This suggests that redundancies must blunt single gene mutant phenotypes. Despite trouble in finding the smallest junctions by TEM, about 6,000 neuronal gap junctions have been identified in the hermaphrodite, and about 10,000 in the adult male (White et al., 1986; Hall and Russell; 1991; Jarrell et al., 2012; Cook et al., in prep.).\n\nIn many instances within the nematode connectome, one finds that the pattern of gap junction connectivity is quite similar or parallel to the pattern of chemical synaptic contacts (White et al., 1986). However, there are certain levels in sensory processing where gap junctions tend to dominate. For instance, a 'hub-and-spoke' pattern has been suggested for the convergence of multiple head sensors to communicate via gap junctions onto a single interneuron, RMG (Macosko et al., 2009) (GapjunctFIG 8). This arrangement may facilitate coordination of several classes of sensory neuron activities, allowing the level of RMG activity to synchronize or facilitate the animal's responses to different modes of input towards a common output. In this case, RMG activity is apparently governing the animal's choice between social behavior and solitary behavior, i.e. encouraging the animal to aggregate with other nematodes. Elsewhere gap junctions ought to allow for better synchronization and faster responses in decision making since synaptic delay is minimized. \n\n 4.4.1 Synapses between layers\n\nAs one inspects intercellular signals flowing from sensory cells to interneurons and then motor neurons (White et al., 1986; Hall and Russell; 1991; Jarrell et al., 2012; Faumont et al., 2012; Varshney et al., 2011), much of the general pattern is produced by chemical synapses. Output from motor neurons onto muscles (NMJs) is limited mostly to chemical signaling. Only a minority of contacts between neuron layers involves gap junctions, and their pattern of contacts is often similar to the chemical synaptic network (GapjunctFIG 7). One difference is that chemical synapses in C. elegans tend to form as dyads, where one presynaptic neuron simultaneously synapses onto 2 or more postsynaptic neurons (White et al., 1986; Hall and Russell; 1991). Gap junctions must occur as one to one cell contacts, so that a neuron seemingly cannot choose multiple gap junction partners at once. Nevertheless, gap junction partnerships operating between cell layers are often the same as principal choices for chemical synaptic partnerships.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4217, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b99a48f-0bd1-47d2-adf9-0630a8362d22": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b99a48f-0bd1-47d2-adf9-0630a8362d22", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 4.4) Nervous System](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2f23a5bf-8533-4fda-aec0-8705cc1be6d8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 4.4) Nervous System](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "hash": "82f2acfc1f0e0576fc3467f2bbc229c2baa9dd10368569fc028b8cea30a530af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b08a7e5a-f286-4fe1-9629-ffede03f0116", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 4.4) Nervous System](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "hash": "047a2da5faac0abb3e9bc09fa8612ffb92e0cf021e38d1071796e955c3aceb45", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3c8008e1-e235-489a-b04a-2a55ac6e3de1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "60c73adfff86f7d59f90e16ad0f6897db3f7541552123445f0cea97dd6403fa0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Output from motor neurons onto muscles (NMJs) is limited mostly to chemical signaling.

Gap junctions must occur as one to one cell contacts, so that a neuron seemingly cannot choose multiple gap junction partners at once. Nevertheless, gap junction partnerships operating between cell layers are often the same as principal choices for chemical synaptic partnerships. Although we still do not understand how most neurons choose those partners (Emmons, 2016; Kim and Emmons, 2017), the same intercellular mechanisms might be used to recognize suitable partners for both chemical and electrical synapses.\n\nThe most well studied gap junctions between two neuron layers are those linking the command interneurons (or 'premotor neurons') of the ventral nerve cord to motor neurons along the same cord, controlling contractions of bodywall muscles (White et al., 1986; Kawano et al., 2011) (GapjunctFIG 7). In this instance, information flow involves parallel use of both chemical synapses and gap junctions. While AVA interneurons connect to all class A motor neurons in the nerve cord, AVB interneurons connect to all class B motor neurons. In the absence of functional electrical connections (encoded by unc-7 and unc-9 genes for these heteromeric gap junctions), mutant animals (unc-7 or unc-9 , or the double mutant) are unable to propagate smooth forward or backward motions, but instead show 'kinking' (severe body bending) in local zones. Electrical contacts between cell layers helps to switch between two opposing sets of ongoing neuronal and muscle activity (favoring either AVA + class A activity, or AVB + class B activity) to allow one set to predominate. Thus, sustained waves of signals pass along the nerve cord and muscles in one direction but not the other (Kawano et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2017). \n\n\n\nA variety of gap junctions has been noted for a pheromone-sensing circuit in the adult hermaphrodite nerve ring (Macosko et al., 2009) (GapjunctFIG 8). Here a single pair of interneurons (RMGL, RMGR) are connected to different sensors in the nose. Most connections rely on gap junctions (only) between the sensor and the interneuron (hub), though there are exceptions where chemical synapses sit parallel to electrical connections. The RMG interneurons become the key for balancing sensory inputs (Macosko et al., 2009). For instance, RMG integrates reception for several pheromones, detected by different receptor neurons, influencing the animal's response, where reception of any single pheromone is generally not sufficient to evoke a response (Jang et al., 2012). RMG then contacts many downstream neurons in the nerve ring and ventral cord, mostly via chemical synapses, to organize responses to those stimuli.\n\nMost sensory neurons in the nematode have ciliated endings in either the nose or the extreme tail tip. However, the touch neuron sensors (ALM, PLM, AVM, PVM) for mild body touch have long sensory dendrites embedded in the bodywall, with receptive territories spanning up to half the body length (Chalfie et al., 1985). Inputs from anterior vs posterior stimuli are compared by pairs of interneurons, particularly the BDUs and command interneurons of the ventral cord, which are in position to compare the relative strength of touch stimuli received from either half of the body.\u00a0 While some synapses from sensors to these interneurons are chemical, several involve only gap junctions. Interestingly, BDU interneurons receive major gap junction inputs from anterior ALMs, and from long processes of the posterior PLMs in a unique lateral position close to the vulva (Zhang et al., 2013). Wnt signaling informs the development and targeting of lengthy PLM and BDU process extensions to bring the two classes together in a unique locale, where processes stop upon forming one large gap junction per side (BDUL to PLML, BDUR to PLMR).\u00a0 These isolated gap junctions were only discovered recently.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3466, "end_char_idx": 7773, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c8008e1-e235-489a-b04a-2a55ac6e3de1": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c8008e1-e235-489a-b04a-2a55ac6e3de1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 4.4) Nervous System](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2f23a5bf-8533-4fda-aec0-8705cc1be6d8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 4.4) Nervous System](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "hash": "82f2acfc1f0e0576fc3467f2bbc229c2baa9dd10368569fc028b8cea30a530af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8b99a48f-0bd1-47d2-adf9-0630a8362d22", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 4.4) Nervous System](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "hash": "99992e9e716b59ecd6377e910f85cf9295971291d8b699f6eb1d4ac554761be8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ea39adab-6bb6-4099-b94b-09ae7f12b350", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9792f366b972724f3411b95f7ee251c5ff24ede4ee055550d229d081be5c5455", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Inputs from anterior vs posterior stimuli are compared by pairs of interneurons, particularly the BDUs and command interneurons of the ventral cord, which are in position to compare the relative strength of touch stimuli received from either half of the body.\u00a0 While some synapses from sensors to these interneurons are chemical, several involve only gap junctions.

Their connections are far removed from the influence of other neurons, away from the major nerve cords. How BDUs handle these different inputs from ALM and PLM is worthy of further study. Their chemical synapses are few, and concentrated in the nerve ring with rather diverse targets. Alternately, BDU might not be comparing touch dendrite inputs, but perhaps modulating excitability of two classes of sensors, ALM and PLM, via these electrical synapses.\n\n 4.4.2 Synapses within a layer\n\nGap junctions commonly link multiple members of a neuron class, including left/right cell pairs in any layer (sensory cell pairs; interneuron pairs; motor neuron groups). Although chemical synapses can also play a similar role, gap junctions often predominate. Given the sparse network, we surmise that such gap junctions can equalize and/or prolong the activity in left/right pairs. They may also compensate where new stimuli have arisen unequally (in terms of sidedness), or even where some chemical synapses are missing or nonfunctional in the overall network. These recurrent contacts within layers are notable (Jarrell et al., 2012). Furthermore, except in special cases, left/right differences in cell activity between homologues are apparently rare in C. elegans. \n\n 4.4.2.1 Left/right balance and signal prolongation\n\nA few left/right pairs of sensory neurons are known to respond to different types of external signals. ASEL vs. ASER is the best known example (Luo et al., 2014; Bargmann, 2006). These chemosensory neurons in the nose detect different salts and water-soluble compounds in the animal's external environment, and are involved in chemotaxis behaviors. ASEL responds primarily to sodium, whereas ASER responds better to chloride and potassium. Interestingly, these two neurons are among the few bilateral homologues in the entire adult connectome that apparently do not form any gap junctions to one another (Altun et al., 2009).\u00a0 This circumstance reinforces the idea that gap junctions underlie synchronization, whereas the two ASE sensors probably operate independently to provide the animal with separable responses to different ions.\n\nAnother pair of olfactory neurons, AWCL/AWCR, have well described gap junctions in the lateral ganglia involving their somata in the late embryo and early L1 larva (see Section 3 Development), but later lose these connections to ASH somata (encoded by the innexin nsy-5) in the adult. These gap junctions are required during the time when the two AWC neurons adopt different cell fates, but are not present in adults, after their olfactory preferences have diverged (Chuang et al., 2007). Either AWC cell can adopt either cell fate, depending on a cascade of signaling involving this gap junction, but when nsy-5 is mutated, the two AWCs can chose identical cell fates. Given the small number of cells available, most sensory cells in C. elegans must respond to multiple extracellular signals (Bargmann, 2006; Rengarajan et al., 2016), unlike in higher animals, where sensory neurons are abundant, and each can express a single receptor type (Malnic et al., 1999).\u00a0 This is not feasible in C. elegans, where the typical sensory neuron expresses many different receptors. Perhaps the more surprising aspect is that so often sensory cell pairs still share gap junctions to their bilateral homologue, since they might have acquired more diverse sensory capabilities if more bilateral sensors could operate separately.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6901, "end_char_idx": 11238, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea39adab-6bb6-4099-b94b-09ae7f12b350": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea39adab-6bb6-4099-b94b-09ae7f12b350", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 4.4) Nervous System](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2f23a5bf-8533-4fda-aec0-8705cc1be6d8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 4.4) Nervous System](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "hash": "82f2acfc1f0e0576fc3467f2bbc229c2baa9dd10368569fc028b8cea30a530af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3c8008e1-e235-489a-b04a-2a55ac6e3de1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 4.4) Nervous System](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "hash": "b7ff9526015e2f16d5517832ccecfd66a5618f48fd0925ee57de1079e7ac5ada", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Either AWC cell can adopt either cell fate, depending on a cascade of signaling involving this gap junction, but when nsy-5 is mutated, the two AWCs can chose identical cell fates.

In the nerve ring, small groups of homologues are coupled by gap junctions to allow coordinated activity; examples include the RMEs, RMDs and a few more. Gap junctions are also common between non-homologues among the sublateral motor neurons, such as SMB to SAA and SMD to RMD.\n\nGap junctions are prominent among motor neurons that lie in sequential fashion along the length of the body in the two major motor nerves, the ventral and dorsal cords (GapjunctFIG 9) (White et al., 1986; Haspel and O'Donovan, 2012). Each motor nerve cord contains sets of 5-12 equivalent neurons each for several classes of motor cells, most having excitatory action onto bodywall muscles. Each excitatory motor neuron has a limited range along the body where it forms chemical neuromuscular junctions. Their ranges do not overlap within a given class, but instead motor neuron axons typically form a single gap junction at the limit of their range onto the next motor axon of the same type (but do not form any chemical synapses between these pairings).\u00a0 In some cases, gap junctions are also formed at the extended limits of their dendrites. Thus, signals can be conducted along the motor nerves as separate streams for each class of motor cell, some of which underlie waves of contraction propagating from head to tail (class B excitors, including DB, VB), while others propagate signals from tail to head (class A excitors, including DA, VA).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 10413, "end_char_idx": 12756, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eeb714cf-a233-4de8-915f-36fedcb56c94": {"__data__": {"id_": "eeb714cf-a233-4de8-915f-36fedcb56c94", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 5) References](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2f04966f-45c1-41c5-a759-1571b9e35e03", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Gap Junctions, Section 5) References](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/gapjunctions/Gapjunctframeset.html)"}, "hash": "2704a5041d7686e3de611b4a8e4b4038d5fc7fd950f7a67c1957ac09f9d5c347", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "This chapter should be cited as: Hall, D.H. 2018.

The intestine is comprised of 20 large epithelial cells that are mostly positioned as bilaterally symmetric pairs to form a long tube around a lumen. Each of these cell pairs forms an intestinal ring (II-IX int rings). The anteriormost intestinal ring (int ring I) is an exception and is comprised of four cells (IntFIG 2). Although the intestine initially fills the entire body cavity behind the pharynx, it becomes deflected to permit the outgrowth of the gonad within the same cavity as the animal ages. The intestine is not rigidly attached to the body wall; rather, it is firmly anchored to the pharyngeal and rectal valves at either end. More tenuous linkages between the basal laminae of the intestine and the body wall form via lengthwise stripes of hemicentin (Vogel and Hedgecock, 2001). The intestine is not directly innervated and has only one associated muscle (the stomatointestinal muscle) at its posterior extreme (see Muscle System - Nonstriated).\n\nThe adult intestine shows a dextral handedness to its position along the length of the animal such that in the anterior, it is localized to the left side and in the posterior, to the right side (IntFIG 1) (Wood et al., 1996).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1627, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "531a75e0-8fb3-4405-8486-3425c3f9c6f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "531a75e0-8fb3-4405-8486-3425c3f9c6f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Intestine, Section 2) Intestinal Development: Transcriptional Mechanisms](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/intestine/Intframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ead23ebd-5547-4aaf-ab4a-2b278c732937", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Intestine, Section 2) Intestinal Development: Transcriptional Mechanisms](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/intestine/Intframeset.html)"}, "hash": "bd1b7f8996904fd81bbc1053163d42cc59f08187159b4b0a4d109bd24c7b5519", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The control of cell fates within C. elegans lineages is primarily determined by cell-autonomous transcriptional decisions within each cell, but there are a few levels at which inductive signals from other cells can impact these decisions. In the case of the intestine, these mechanisms have been explored in detail and thus provide an excellent example of how this animal regulates cell fates.\n\nUnlike many lineages, the intestinal cells derive from a single progenitor cell E, such that the clonal proliferation of the E lineage constitutes the whole intestine (Goldstein, 1992). Some maternally contributed mRNAs play key roles in the transcriptional patterns in early steps of this lineage. E is the posterior daughter of the mesendodermal precursor EMS, whereas the anterior daughter is the mesodermal precursor MS. EMS itself derives from the blast cell P1, which divides to generate EMS and P2 (AlimFIG 1). During regulation of early blastomere fates, a transcription factor SKN-1, whose mRNA is contributed maternally, is produced asymmetrically at high levels in P1 and its descendants. (Schnabel and Priess, 1997; Maduro and Rothman, 2002). In EMS, SKN-1 activates expression of med genes, encoding GATA-type transcription factors, and marks the switch from maternal to zygotic control in mesendoderm specification. Downstream from MED proteins, other GATA-type transcription factors carry out intestinal differentiation and maintenance through activation of intestine specific genes encoding, among others, an acid-phosphatase, a cysteine protease and metallothioneins, which results in a fully-functional intestine.\n\nIn addition to these transcriptional cascades, a cell-cell inductive interaction between EMS and P2 is required to produce an endoderm-producing E cell in a 4-cell embryo (IntFIG 3). Through this interaction, which involves Wnt/MAPK signaling, the posterior part of EMS that contacts P2 gives rise to the E blastomere, whereas the anterior part produces MS.

The daughters of E, E.a and E.p, migrate into the interior of the embryo initiating gastrulation when the embryo is at the 26-cell stage (Bucher and Seydoux, 1994, Nance et al., 2005). At the E16 stage, the intestinal primordium has a ventral tier of six cells and a dorsal tier of ten cells (IntFIG 4). About 30 min into the E16 stage, cytoplasmic polarization of intestinal cells occurs such that the nuclei of cells move towards and cytoplasmic components move away from the midline (Leung et al., 1999). Shortly afterwards, cell separation starts at the midline as small gaps, and these small gaps eventually become the lumen of the intestine. At the same time, electron-dense vesicles begin to appear in the cytoplasm and localize near the basal pole. These vesicles may correspond to the intestine-specific gut granules (IntFIG 1). At E16-E20, two ventral cell pairs intercalate between the dorsal cells, resulting in a single layer of intestinal cells with bilateral symmetry. As the second cell intercalation occurs, neighboring int II, int III and int IV rings initiate a coordinated 90\u00b0 clockwise rotation around the axis of the midline. Between 430 min following first cell division and hatching, intestinal rings VII-IX make coordinated 90\u00b0 counter-clockwise rotation which leads to the twisted appearance of the intestine in the newly hatched larva (IntFIG 3) (Sulston and Horvitz, 1977; Mendenhall et al., 2015). As a result, int 5L connects to int 4V and int 6L connects to int 7L in the adjoining rings (Mendenhall et al., 2015; A. Mendenhall, pers. comm.; Z. F. Altun and D. H. Hall, unpub. observations). The cells in int V and/or int VI rings get variably pushed to the right or left side by the developing uterus in subsequent stages and, hence, their nuclei are stochastically located to the right or left of the midline. The forces or developmental processes that influence the positions of these cells in postembryonic life are still unknown. By the adult stage, the intestine is composed of 20 cells with a total of 30-34 nuclei and 32C per nucleus (IntFIG 4X).These cell movements result in a superhelical twist of the intestine, displacing the anterior half to the left side of the larval body and the posterior half to the right side. This twist of the intestine, in turn, is suggested to lead to the asymmetrical growth of the gonad later in life (Hermann et al., 2000). The left-right rotational asymmetry of this twist is determined by the LIN-12/Notch pathway and involves LAG-2, APX-1 and LAG-1 proteins. Also a pathway involving POP-1 and LIT-1 limits this twist to the anterior half of the intestine. Subsequently, the intestinal primordium elongates (Hermann et al., 2000). By the time of hatching, the anterior intestinal rings may make an additional 90\u00b0 rotation (IntFIG 2 and IntFIG 3) (Sulston and Horvitz, 1977). This second turn of the anterior intestinal cells seems to be variable, however, because cells in int II-IV rings can often be seen as dorsoventral to each other in adult animals. Similarly, orientation of cells in the adult int VI-IX rings is variable. Rings VI-VIII tend to adopt L/R positions, whereas ring IX cells are usually positioned dorsoventrally (Z.F. Altun and D.H.

Through this process, each cell acquires distinctive apical and basal surfaces. During subsequent embryogenesis, the apical membranes of cells between the adherens junctions increase greatly in area as microvilli develop, and correspondingly, the apical surface of the intestine expands. In addition, later, the cytoplasmic polarization disappears so that intestinal nuclei are found in the center of the cells and other organelles are more evenly dispersed within the cytoplasm (Leung et al, 1999).\n\nIntestinal cells become binucleate and polyploid during post-embryonic development (Hedgecock and White, 1985). At the beginning of the lethargus of the first molt, most of the intestinal nuclei, except the anteriormost 6, divide without accompanied cell divisions giving rise to 20 intestinal cells with a total of 30-34 nuclei. Despite a large increase in tissue volume, the intestine continues to grow without further cell or nuclei divisions. Intestinal nuclei continue to increase in size and go through repeated endoreduplications (chromosome duplication without karyokinesis), increasing the ploidy of each nucleus to 32C by the final molt. These endoreduplications are generally synchronized to each period of lethargus, resulting in a twofold increase in chromosomal number at the end of each molt.

Each intestinal cell forms part of the intestinal lumen at its apical pole and secretes the constituents of the basal lamina from its basal pole. The intestinal basal lamina contains laminin \u03b1 and \u03b2 nidogen/entactin, which are made by the intestine, and type IV collagen, which is made by the muscle and somatic gonad (Graham et al., 1997; Kang and Kramer, 2000; Huang et al., 2003; Kao et al., 2006). Each intestinal cell is sealed laterally to its neighbors by large adherens junctions close to the apical side (Labousse, 2006). It also connects to the neighboring intestinal cells via gap junctions on the lateral sides (IntFIG 5). The lateral membranes also display a region of tightly folded plasma membranes that may represent another specialized intercellular junction of novel form.\n\nMany microvilli extend into the lumen from the apical face, forming a brush border (IntFIG 5). The microvilli are anchored into a strong cytoskeletal network of intermediate filaments at their base, called the terminal web. The core of each microvillus has a bundle of actin filaments that connects to this web. Over the microvilli, there is an extracellular electron-lucent coating of highly modified glycoproteins (a glycocalyx), which may function to localize digestive enzymes, protect microvilli from physical or toxic injury or serve as a filter (Lehane, 1997). The villi may be somewhat shorter in the first int ring than in subsequent cells along the body axis (Sulston and Horvitz, 1977).\n\nThe intestinal cells are each very large and contain large nuclei with a prominent nucleolus, many mitochondria, extensive rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), many ribosomes, and an extensive collection of membrane-bound vesicles and vacuoles. The nature of these organelles changes gradually as the animal ages. The digestive and metabolic activities of the intestine are central to the growth and development of the animal, and correspondingly, these organelles include yolk granules, recycling endosomes, autophagic vacuoles, and autofluorescent (gut) granules. Using light microscopy, some of these gut granules become visible as birefringent objects in older adults and are inferred to be secondary lysosomes involved in catabolism (Clokey and Jacobson, 1986).\n\nThe primary function of intestinal cells seems to be digestive because they secrete digestive enzymes (e.g. cysteine protease endodeoxyribonuclease) into the lumen and take up processed material and nutrients. The intestine also seems to be a large storage organ because it contains a large number of assorted storage granules that change in size, shape and number during development (White, 1988). In hermaphrodites, the intestine is also involved in synthesis and secretion of yolk material that is then transported to the oocytes through the body cavity (Kimble and Sharrock, 1983). The intestinal contents may also play role in miscellaneous functions carried out by nonintestinal cells in higher animals. For instance, the glycosyltransferases, which function in carbohydrate metabolism, comprise more than 70 genes in the C. elegans genome, and at least some appear to be expressed in the digestive tract (Griffitts et al., 2003; McKay et al., 2004). In addition, along with muscle, intestine is thought to be the major organ in which fatty acid metabolism takes place. Through the function of a glyoxylate cyclase (SRH-1) yolk fatty acid-derived acetylcoenzymeA is converted to succinate, from which carbohydrates are synthesized (Liu et al., 1995).\n\nAnatomical and gene expression data both suggest that these functions differ along the length of the organ. For instance, the collection of membrane-bound organelles and vacuoles is more diverse and much more extensive in int rings I and II than further posterior (Borgonie et al., 1995).

Without histochemical staining, it is still difficult to assign functions to each type of endosome, but open vacuoles of the anterior organ were proposed to release digestive enzymes into the gut lumen. In support of this observation, cysteine protease (CPR-1) expression is restricted to the anterior portions (among int rings I-VI) of the intestine (Britton et al., 1998). Yolk and lipid vacuoles predominate in posterior portions of the intestine, and these cells may be more active in nutrient and energy storage.\n\nThe posterior intestine also functions as the pacemaker of the defecation cycle. In C. elegans, defecation occurs in a rhythmic manner in tightly regulated cycles that are approximately 50 seconds long and have three distinct muscle contraction steps (see Alimentary system - Rectum). Inositol triphosphate (IP3) receptor-driven calcium oscillations in the posterior intestinal cells initiate the muscle contractions of the defecation cycle and the IP3 receptor is a central component of the timekeeping mechanism that regulates this behavioral rhythm (Dal Santo, 1999; see also Alimentary system - Rectum).\n\nRecent studies show intestine functions as a cold temperature sensor (intestinal cells exhibit a robust increase in calcium level in response to cooling).This calcium response is greatly reduced in trpa-1 mutant worms, consistent with an important role for TRPA-1 in cold-reception in intestine and cold-dependent lifespan extension (Xiao et al., 2013).\n\nThe intestine may change in shape and function rather dramatically in the dauer larva, which do not feed (Popham and Webster, 1979). The lumen becomes shrunken and the size and number of microvilli are greatly reduced (Albert and Riddle, 1988).

It is an important model system for biological research in many fields including genomics, cell biology, neuroscience and aging (http://www.wormbook.org/). Among its many advantages for study are its short life cycle, compact genome, stereotypical development, ease of propagation and small size. The adult body plan is anatomically simple with about 1000 somatic cells. C. elegans is amenable to genetic crosses and produces a large number of progeny per adult. It reproduces with a life cycle of about 3 days under optimal conditions. The animal can be maintained in the laboratory where it is grown on agar plates or liquid cultures with E. coli as the food source. It can be examined at the cellular level in living preparations by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, because it is transparent throughout its life cycle. The anatomical description of the whole animal has been completed at the electron microscopy level and its complete cell lineage, which is invariant between animals, has been established (Brenner, 1973; Byerly et al., 1976; Sulston et al., 1983; Wood, 1988a; Lewis and Fleming, 1995).\n\nThere are two C. elegans sexes: a self-fertilizing hermaphrodite (XX) and a male (XO). Males arise infrequently (0.1%) by spontaneous non-disjunction in the hermaphrodite germ line and at higher frequency (up to 50%) through mating. Self-fertilization of the hermaphrodite allows for homozygous worms to generate genetically identical progeny, and male mating facilitates the isolation and maintenance of mutant strains as well as moving mutations between strains.\n\nMutant animals are readily obtained by chemical mutagenesis or exposure to ionizing radiation (Anderson, 1995; Jorgensen and Mango, 2002). The strains can be kept as frozen stocks for long periods of time. C. elegans can also endure harsh environmental conditions by switching to a facultative diapause stage called the dauer larva which can survive four to eight times the normal 3-week life span (Cassada and Russell, 1975).\n\nDespite its simple anatomy, the animal displays a large repertoire of behavior including locomotion; foraging; feeding; defecation; egg laying; dauer larva formation; sensory responses to touch, smell, taste, and temperature; and some complex behaviors like male mating, social behavior, and learning and memory (Rankin, 2002; de Bono, 2003).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2545, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "181ef9a3-33e2-4dce-ba31-cd07cbdbc799": {"__data__": {"id_": "181ef9a3-33e2-4dce-ba31-cd07cbdbc799", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Introduction, Section 2) Adult Anatomy](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/introduction/Introframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f5a54c89-6eea-4fd5-bda4-8b39daa31b09", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Introduction, Section 2) Adult Anatomy](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/introduction/Introframeset.html)"}, "hash": "dfaa90b9f1d0497f2836e7a73b6e332125ba378ff023382491970708da76b0d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 0, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "812bca3d-dc59-472a-b73d-40b763c160dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "812bca3d-dc59-472a-b73d-40b763c160dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Introduction, Section 2.1) Body Shape](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/introduction/Introframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "99d8d6eb-bd55-49df-b0e7-bca343ffeb08", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Introduction, Section 2.1) Body Shape](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/introduction/Introframeset.html)"}, "hash": "e96bd29043c6172b3b1ccfff61fa0679ab6eeacbf7c5d4957c58caeca4fbea5a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Similar to other nematodes, C. elegans has an unsegmented, cylindrical body shape that is tapered at the ends (IntroFIG 1; IntroMOVIE 1).

A collagenous cuticle, secreted by the underlying epithelium, surrounds the worm on the outside and also lines the pharynx and rectum (see Cuticle). Various tissues open to the outside through this cuticle (IntroFIG 3). The excretory pore is located at midline on the ventral side of the head (IntroFIG 3E). The vulva is another large opening on the ventral side at the midbody (IntroFIG 3D), and the anus forms another ventral opening, just before the tail whip (IntroFIG 3B). Two cuticular inpockets form narrow openings at the lateral lips for the amphid sensilla (IntroFIG 4A and IntroTABLE 1). The lips also contain papillae for 6 inner labial (IL) sensilla and small bumps for 6 outer labial (OL) sensilla, as well as 4 cephalic (CEP) sensilla (IntroFIG 4A and IntroTABLE 1). There are two papillae for anterior deirids at the posterior of the head. These are situated within the lateral alae at the level of the excretory pore (IntroFIG4C and ExcFIG2B). The two posterior deirid sensilla are situated dorsal to the cuticular alae (IntroFIG 4B&C). Two much narrower openings on the lateral sides of the tail whip exist for the phasmid sensilla at the junction of the seam cells and the tail hypodermis (IntroFIG 4C).\n\n\n\nThe Epithelial System . The hypodermis, which secretes cuticle, is made up of the main body syncytium (hyp 7), a series of concentric rings of five smaller syncytial cells in the head, and three mononucleate and one syncytial cell in the tail (see Hypodermis). On the lateral sides, the hypodermis is interrupted by the syncytial row of seam cells which form alae on the cuticle surface during certain developmental stages (IntroFIG 3C) (see Seam Cells). The hypodermis and the inner tissues that open to the outside are connected to one another by specialized interfacial cells.\n\nThe Nervous System . The cells of the nervous system are organized into ganglia in the head and tail. The majority of C. elegans neurons are located in the head around the pharynx. In the body, a continuous row of neuron cell bodies lies at the midline, adjacent to the ventral hypodermis. In addition, there are two small posterior lateral ganglia on the sides, as well as some scattered neurons along the lateral body. The processes from most neurons travel in either the ventral or dorsal nerve cord and project to the nerve ring (NR) in the head which constitutes the major neuropil in the animal (IntroFIG 2C)(see Nervous System).\n\nThe Muscle System .  Neurons and the hypodermis are separated from the musculature by a thin basal lamina. The muscles receive input from the neurons by sending muscle arms to motor neuron processes that run along the nerve cords or reside in the nerve ring. The obliquely striated body wall muscles are arranged into strips in four quadrants, two dorsal and two ventral, along the whole length of the animal ( IntroFIG 2A-F ) (see Somatic Muscle System ). Smaller, nonstriated muscles are found in the pharynx and around the vulva, intestine and rectum (see Nonstriated Muscle System ).\n\nThe Excretory System . Four cells situated on the ventral side of the posterior head make up the excretory system, which functions in osmoregulation and waste disposal. The excretory system opens to the outside through the excretory pore ( IntroFIG 3E ) (see Excretory System ).2.2.2 Pseudocoelomic Cavity Organs\n\nThe Coelomocyte system.

The pharynx is separated from the outer tube of tissues and pseudocoelom by its own basal lamina (IntroFIG 2B-D). The lumen of the pharynx is continuous with the lumen of the intestine, and the pharynx passes ground food into the intestine via the intestinal pharyngeal valve. The intestine, which is the only somatic tissue derived from a single (E blast cell) lineage, is made of 20 cells arranged to form a tube with a central lumen. The apical surfaces of the intestinal cells carry numerous microvilli. The intestinal contents are excreted to the outside via a rectal valve that connects the gut to the rectum and anus. The four enteric muscles that contribute to defecation are located around the rectum and posterior intestine (see Alimentary System Sections: Pharynx, Intestine and Rectum and Anus).\n\nThe Reproductive system . This system consists of somatic gonad, the germ line and the egg-laying apparatus. There are two bilaterally symmetric, U-shaped gonad arms that are connected to a central uterus through the spermatheca (IntroFIG 1). The germ line within the distal gonad arms (ovaries) is syncytial with germline nuclei surrounding a central cytoplasmic core. More proximally, germ cells pass sequentially through the mitotic, meiotic prophase and diakinesis stages. As they pass through the bend of the gonad arm (oviduct), oocytes enlarge, detach from the syncytium, and mature as they move more proximally. The oocytes are fertilized by the sperm in spermatheca. The resulting diploid zygotes are stored in the uterus and laid outside thorough the vulva, which protrudes at the ventral midline (see Reproductive System: Somatic Gonad, Germ Line and Egg-laying Apparatus).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3043, "end_char_idx": 5504, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ec8abc39-be23-4e13-83d0-ff8c9de027ac": {"__data__": {"id_": "ec8abc39-be23-4e13-83d0-ff8c9de027ac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Introduction, Section 2.3) Adult Male Anatomy](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/introduction/Introframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ced9c29e-ae5d-49ba-97e0-b799037f8289", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Introduction, Section 2.3) Adult Male Anatomy](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/introduction/Introframeset.html)"}, "hash": "907f95cf8e6e6aa737bfbe75f6985254186078d72472e30143d27260a2ae57e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The male anatomy is the subject of a separate section (Male Handbook), but here we provide an overview of major differences between the male and the hermaphrodite sexes.

With the exception of perhaps the pharynx and the excretory system, virtually all tissue systems exhibit some degree of sexual dimorphism. The most profound differences are seen in tissues of the posterior, which bears the male copulatory apparatus. The muscle system of the male contains 41 additional sex-specific muscles (see Male-Specific Muscles). The reproductive system consists of a single-armed gonad (IntroFIG 5C; Male Somatic Gonad and Germline) that opens to the exterior at the cloaca (anus) via a modified rectal epithelial chamber called the proctodeum (IntroFIG 5D) (see Proctodeum). The proctodeum includes two sclerotic sensory spicules used by the male during mating to locate the hermaphrodite vulval slit and to hold the vulva open during sperm transfer (Liu and Sternberg, 1995; Garcia et al., 2001). The nervous system has 91 additional neurons that include several classes of tail sensilla: the rays, which extend from the tail and lie in a cuticular fan (see Rays); the hook (see Hook); and the post-cloacal sensilla, which are located on the ventral exterior of the tail (see PCS).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1572, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c07550dd-d6a7-45d0-9444-36fd4d055508": {"__data__": {"id_": "c07550dd-d6a7-45d0-9444-36fd4d055508", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Introduction, Section 3) Life cycle](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/introduction/Introframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "30b198a7-8897-4588-b1cd-2b628322b4c1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Introduction, Section 3) Life cycle](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/introduction/Introframeset.html)"}, "hash": "9f3e2394e5bd01e3c6ea79a5da2b22017d9f7d97e4be9341a90689317cec62dc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Similar to other nematodes, the life cycle of C. elegans is comprised of the embryonic stage, four larval stages (L1-L4) and adulthood.

Proliferation (0 to 330-350 min post-fertilization at 22'C) includes cell divisions from a single cell to about 550 essentially undifferentiated cells by the end of the '16 E stage' (von Ehrenstein and Schierenberg, 1980; Wood, 1988b). This stage is further subdivided into two phases: The first phase (0-150 min) spans the time between zygote formation to generation of embryonic founder cells, and the second phase (150-350 min) covers the bulk of cell divisions and gastrulation until the beginning of organogenesis (Bucher and Seydoux, 1994). The initial 150 min of proliferation takes place within the mother's uterus, and the embryo is laid outside when it reaches the approximate 30-cell stage (at gastrulation). There is considerable rearrangement of cells in the proliferation stage because of short-range shuffling, and once gastrulation begins, because of specific cell migrations (during gastrulation Ea and Ep sink in from the posterior and enter into the embryo at 100 min after first cell cleavage. P4 and MS progeny enter at 120-200 min, followed by C and D myoblasts entering from the posterior. AB-derived pharynx progenitors enter inside at 210-250 min. Once the cell migrations are completed, ventral cleft through which cells migrated in closes proceeding from the posterior (230 min) to anterior. Ventral cleft closure is completed at 290 min.) From this time onward, the embryonic substages can be defined by specific cell migrations, gain in cell number, and periods of synchronous stem-cell divisions.\n\nAt the end of the proliferation stage, the embryo is a spheroid of cells organized into three germ layers: ectoderm, which gives rise to hypodermis and neurons; mesoderm, which generates pharynx and muscle; and endoderm, which gives rise to germline and intestine. During the organogenesis/morphogenesis stage (5.5-6 hr to 12-14 hr), terminal differentiation of cells occurs without many additional cell divisions, and the embryo elongates threefold and takes form as an animal with fully differentiated tissues and organs. Morphogenesis starts with the 'lima bean' stage. The first muscle twitches are observed at 430 min after the first cell cleavage (between 1.5- and 2-fold stages) (IntroFIG 7). Sexual dimorphism becomes visible for the first time at 510 minutes when the cephalic companion neurons (CEMs) die in the hermaphrodite, and when the hermaphrodite-specific neurons (HSNs) die in the male. In the late three-fold stage, the worm can move inside the egg in a coordinated fashion (rolling around its longitudinal axis), indicating advanced motor system development. The embryo starts pharyngeal pumping at 760 min after the first cell cleavage and hatches at 800 min (von Ehrenstein and Schierenberg, 1980; Sulston et al, 1983; Bird and Bird, 1991).\n\nThe main body plan of the animal is already established at the end of embryogenesis. This general body plan does not change during postembryonic development.\n\n3.2 Post-embryonic Development\n\nPost-embryonic development is triggered by feeding after hatching. In the presence of food, cell divisions resume and the post-embryonic developmental program begins 3 hours after hatching (Ambros, 2000). The animal normally passes through four larval stages to reach adulthood (IntroFIG 8, IntroMOVIE 2). Numerous blast cells set aside at the end of embryogenesis divide in nearly invariant temporal and spatial patterns through the four larval stages and give rise to a fixed number of cells with determined fates (see Cell lineages; Sulston and Horvitz, 1977; Wood 1988b).

Of the 671 nuclei generated in the embryo, 113 undergo programmed death in the course of development (Sulston et al, 1983; Bird, and Bird, 1991). About 10% of the remaining 558 cells in a newly hatched larva (51 in hermaphrodites, 55 in the male) are blast cells that will divide further (Sulston and Horvitz, 1977; von Ehrenstein and Schierenberg, 1980). If the embryos hatch in the absence of food, however, they arrest development until food becomes available. Such larvae can survive up to 6-10 days without feeding (IntroFIG 6) (Johnson et al., 1984). After food becomes available, these arrested L1 stage larvae progress through normal molting and development (Slack and Ruvkun, 1997).\n\n3.2.1 L1 Larva\n\nNervous system . Of the eight classes of motor neurons (DAn, DBn, VAn, VBn, VCn, ASn, VDn, and DDn) in the adult hermaphrodite ventral cord, five (VAn, VBn, VCn, ASn and VDn) are generated at the end of the L1 stage from 13 precursors (W and P1-P12) (IntroFIG 8A) (Sulston, 1976; Sulston and Horvitz, 1977; Chalfie and White 1988). A few other neurons are generated from Q, G1, H2 and T blast cells. Also, during the L1 stage, one class of ventral cord motor neurons (DDn) go through complete synaptic reorganization without any cell-shape change. The initial pattern of synapses made by DD neurons is presynaptic and inhibitory to ventral body wall muscles, while being postsynaptic to neurons that activate dorsal body wall muscles. During late L1, after the birth of VD motor neurons, DD neurons change their synaptic pattern such that their dorsal branches become presynaptic and inhibitory to dorsal body wall muscles, whereas their ventral branches become postsynaptic to excitatory neurons that synapse on ventral body wall muscles (White et al., 1978; Walthall et al., 1993).\n\nReproductive System. During the second half of L1, somatic gonad precursors Z1 and Z4 produce 12 cells in the hermaphrodite (IntroFIG 8C). The germ line precursors Z2 and Z3 also start to divide.

In this stage, the germ cell (Z2 and Z3 daughters) divisions continue, approximately quadrupling in number (IntroFIG 8D). However, no divisions occur in Z1 and Z4 (somatic primordial gonad) lineages. Somatic and germ cells are intermingled until the L2/L3 molt whereupon they rearrange to establish the general organization of the future gonad: distal tip cells positioned at the anterior and posterior ends, an anterior and posterior arm germ-line population, and a somatic gonadal primordium at the center (Kimble and Hirsh, 1979). The gonad begins to elongate, led by the DTC cells.\n\nMale. Cells of the male gonad also rearrange to resemble the adult form, with somatic gonad cells towards the posterior and germ cells displaced to the anterior. At about the L1/L2 molt, the gonad extends, but only at one end, and is led by the linker cell (Antebi et al., 1997). Approximately at the mid-L2 stage, the linker cell halts and reorients to move dorsally.\n\n3.2.3 Dauer Larva - see Dauer Handbook\n\nAt the end of the L2 stage, the animal may enter an arrested state called the dauer larva if the environmental conditions are not favorable for further growth. Environmental factors, including the presence of a pheromone (an indicator of population density), absence of food, and high temperature act as signals that can trigger formation of a morphologically distinct L2-stage larva, designated L2d (see Regulation of Diapause). The critical period for this dauer signal begins after the middle of the first larval stage.\u00a0The L2d larva retains the potential to form either a dauer larva or an L3 larva, depending on the persistence of the dauer inducing environmental parameters (Riddle, 1988). If the environment continues to be disadvantageous, the L2d-stage larva molts into a dauer (IntroFIG 6). The dauer is a non-aging state because its duration does not affect postdauer life span. During the dauer state, feeding is arrested indefinitely and locomotion is markedly reduced. The dauer state ends when the animal experiences favorable conditions. Within 1 hour of accessing food, the animal exits the dauer stage; after 2-3 hours it starts to feed, and after about 10 hours, it molts to the L4 stage.\n\nMorphologically, dauer larvae are very thin (with a length-width ratio of about 30:1) and have a thick, altered cuticle (DCutFIG 1 and DCutFIG 2) (see Cuticle System and Dauer Cuticle). The buccal cavity is sealed by a cuticular block (DCutFIG 4), the gut cells have a dark appearance and the pharyngeal and intestinal lumens are shrunken (DPhaFIG 4), with small and indistinct microvilli in the intestine (see Dauer Pharynx and Dauer Intestine). The excretory gland lacks secretory granules, although the excretory pore remains open (see Dauer Excretory). The gonad of the dauer is arrested at the L2 stage (IntroFIG 8E) (Cassada and Russell, 1975; Riddle, 1988; Sulston, 1988).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 5906, "end_char_idx": 9673, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "60800917-36bc-4f88-ac02-ab9773fdee2a": {"__data__": {"id_": "60800917-36bc-4f88-ac02-ab9773fdee2a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Introduction, Section 3.1) Embryo](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/introduction/Introframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d7a58225-8653-4b8a-aa49-ba8b06cd5a7f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Introduction, Section 3.1) Embryo](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/introduction/Introframeset.html)"}, "hash": "0a12d7b221ffbcbd9c28909ab9d7710a999d68e256f90dc01fd0ac238d1fefe9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "964f2dac-b9bf-425f-9c9d-0af8aa538193", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Introduction, Section 3.1) Embryo](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/introduction/Introframeset.html)"}, "hash": "5da4d713dac7f9da6b526339eb5518d594f00363983ad3b8e6f882eab8a06ef4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "43829c2e-8a4d-47bf-b57d-94efd98e5def", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cbc19ccb9da6f5dfdbd9d58fbdcb7e281adfeedcfa798c5ddae03e2cea170569", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The buccal cavity is sealed by a cuticular block (DCutFIG 4), the gut cells have a dark appearance and the pharyngeal and intestinal lumens are shrunken (DPhaFIG 4), with small and indistinct microvilli in the intestine (see Dauer Pharynx and Dauer Intestine).

During L3, as well as the first part of L4, somatic gonad precursors yield a total of 143 cells that form the anterior and posterior gonadal sheaths, the spermathecae and the uterus (Kimble and Hirsh, 1979). The extension of gonad arms continues in opposite directions until mid-L3 when distal tip cells halt and then slowly start to reorient themselves in dorsal directions (Antebi et al., 1997) (IntroFIG 8F, also see Somatic Gonad). Vulval precursor fates are specified, and committed cells divide to generate vulval terminal cells by early L4. The two sex myoblasts, formed in L3, divide to generate16 sex muscle cells (see Egg-Laying Apparatus).\n\nMale. Somatic gonad blast cells divide to generate 53 somatic gonad cells that will form the vas deferens and the seminal vesicle. The male linker cell of the somatic gonad reorients and migrates posteriorly until mid-L3 extending the proximal gonad. After mid-L3, the male linker cell migrates obliquely towards the ventral midline (Antebi et al., 1997). Six male sex myoblasts are generated. As posterior blast cells divide, the tail become visibly swollen when viewed under the dissecting scope (IntroFIG 5E). Posterior Pn.p cells divide to add 16 cells to the preanal ganglion. More anterior Pn.p lineages contribute cells to the ventral nerve cord. Rectal lineages produce proctodeal cells and several tail sensilla (Sulston et al., 1980; Sulston, 1988). In the male germline, which produces only sperm, meiosis begins during L3 stage.\n\n3.2.5 L4 Larva\n\nReproductive system. Gonadogenesis, which starts at approximately 7 hours after hatching, is completed in the L4 stage. The distal gonad arms continue their migration centripetally along the dorsal body wall muscles, and by the L4/adult molt, they complete their trajectory close to midline (Antebi et al, 1997). Meiosis in the germ line begins at L3/L4 molt in the proximal arms of the gonad, and the germ cells differentiate into mature sperm. At the L4/adult molt, sperm production stops and the remaining germline cells  continue to undergo meiosis and differentiation to generate exclusively oocytes instead. Vulval and uterine terminal cell generation is followed by tissue morphogenesis (IntroFIG 8G). Egg-laying neurons (VCs and HSNs) and sex muscles, generated from sex myoblasts, associate with these structures to form the egg-laying apparatus. (Greenwald, 1997).\n\nMale. 41 male sex muscles and a coelomocyte are formed from the M mesoblast lineage during the L4 stage in males (Sulston et al., 1980). The cells around the rectum form the proctodeum. This epithelium expands to surround the cloacal chamber, which contains the spicules. The gonad continues to grow posteriorly along the ventral midline, and the vas deferens and the seminal vesicle differentiate. The linker cell reaches the developing cloaca by mid-L4 where it dies and is then engulfed by two cells of the proctodeum, thereby opening the vas deferens to the outside (Sulston, 1988; Antebi et al., 1997).

Tail tip hypodermal cells remodel, generating the rounded tail of the adult (IntroFIG 5E) (Nguyen et al., 1999). The tail seam (SET) is formed. Eventually, a general forward movement of posterior tissues and collapse of the cuticle reshape the male tail and generates the copulatory bursa with rays and fan, as well as the ventral hook and post-cloacal sensilla (Emmons and Sternberg, 1997).\n\n3.2.6 Adult\n\nAt approximately at 45-50 hrs posthatch at 22'C-25'C, a newly matured hermaphrodite lays its first eggs, hence completing its 3-day reproductive life cycle (Byerly et al., 1976; Lewis and Fleming, 1995). The adult hermaphrodite produces oocytes for about 4 days, and after this fertile period of 3-4 days, the mature adult lives for an additional 10-15 days. A hermaphrodite that self-fertilizes can produce about 300 progeny because of the limited number of sperm, but if mating with a male occurs, the progeny number can increase to 1200-1400. Males can successfully mate with a hermaphrodite for 6 days after their last larval molt and can father approximately 3000 progeny (Hodgkin, 1988).\n\nOut of 1090 somatic cells generated during hermaphrodite development, 131 undergo programmed cell death at characteristic times (Driscoll, 1995). Hence, the adult C. elegans hermaphrodite has 959 somatic nuclei, 302 of which are neurons and 95 are body wall muscle cells (White, 1988). The adult male, on the other hand, has 1031 somatic nuclei and 381 of these are neurons (extra neurons are mostly dedicated to male mating behavior) (White, 1988). Although it has more cells, the adult C. elegans male is more slender and slightly shorter (approx. 0.8 mm) than the hermaphrodite (IntroFIG5).

Bacteria taken in by the mouth are concentrated, ground and transported to the intestine by a tube-like muscular pump called the pharynx. The pharynx is an epithelial organ that has its own muscles, nervous system, gland cells and structural cells. It contains 9 epithelial cells, 20 muscle cells, 9 marginal cells, 4 gland cells and 20 neurons (PhaFIG 1), and 6 valve cells at its posterior (see also PharynxAtlas). It is about 100 \u00b5m long and has a diameter of approximately 20 \u00b5m at its widest (at the posterior bulb). At the anterior, it is connected to the buccal cavity and at the posterior, to the intestine. The pharynx is isolated from the rest of the animal by a specialized basal lamina that lines the basal surface of the pharyngeal cells and isolates the pharynx from the pseudocoelom. There may be hormonal signaling between this organ and the rest of the body by way of the pseudocoelomic fluid. The apical surface of the pharyngeal cells lies medially towards the lumen, which is lined with a cuticle secreted by the pharyngeal muscle and marginal cells. At several locations pharyngeal cuticle takes the form of specialized structures, such as the anterior \u0093flaps\u0094, the \u0093sieve\u0094 and the \u0093grinder\u0094 (PhaFIG 2; see Cuticle) (Avery and and Thomas, 1997).\n\nThe pharynx has a distinctive shape; an extended anterior portion (procorpus) is connected to the buccal cavity via the pharyngeal epithelium (Albertson and Thomson, 1976; Franks et al., 2006). The metacorpus, also called the first bulb, lies posterior to the procorpus. The procorpus and metacorpus together make the corpus of the pharynx. Between the corpus and the second bulb (also called the terminal bulb) lies the isthmus (PhaFIG 2). The large somatic nerve ring surrounds the isthmus on the outside.\n\nThe pharynx has intrinsic myogenic activity that is regulated by its nervous system. When the entire pharyngeal nervous system is ablated, the pharynx continues to pump, albeit in a slow and uncoordinated manner (Avery and Horvitz, 1989). The nervous system, in turn, integrates internal signals such as the animal\u0092s nutritional status and external signals such as the presence or absence of food (Avery and Horvitz, 1989; Franks et al., 2006). In the absence of food, the pharynx pumps approximately once every second, whereas in the presence of food the rate increases to about four pumps per second. Starved and well-fed worms show initially different pumping rates upon transfer from solid to liquid media (Avery et al., 1993; McCloskey et al., 2017). The pumping rate of the pharynx is also modulated by the somatic sensory system; for example, pumping is briefly inhibited upon sensing a light touch to the body (Chalfie et al., 1985; Avery and Thomas., 1997).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2794, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e508a8a2-fae8-462b-b8aa-eca44352b3cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "e508a8a2-fae8-462b-b8aa-eca44352b3cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Pharynx, Section 2) Embryonic Development of the Pharynx](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/pharynx/Phaframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "51aa19c3-221b-45da-81e0-40345adff843", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Pharynx, Section 2) Embryonic Development of the Pharynx](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/pharynx/Phaframeset.html)"}, "hash": "9886b9b5ecededbfb211fc7de81e0b74360d41e92bfbc81238e829662f03925c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Unlike the intestinal cells, all of which arise from a single founder cell E, the pharynx is composed of cells that arise from both AB and MS founder cells (AlimFIG 1). In these lineages, no strict clonal and lineal derivation can be recognized, and there is a heterogeneity of ancestry with respect to the final cell fate (PhaMOVIE 1&2). In the anterior divisions, no lineal boundaries exist between hypodermal, arcade and pharyngeal daughters. The pharyngeal components derived from MS and AB do not possess any functional boundaries either, such that in pm3, pm4 and pm5 muscle groups identical cells arise from these two lineages and some MS descendants fuse with those coming from the AB blast cell (Sulston et al., 1983; Horner et al., 1998).\n\nDuring gastrulation, at approximately the 100-cell stage and after the movement of gut precursors to inside of the embryo, MS descendants start to move inward through the blastopore (AlimFIG 1 and PhaFIG 3A-D) (Bucher and Seydoux, 1994; Mango, 2007). Slightly later, AB-derived precursors of the pharynx move inside of the embryo. At 150-260 minutes, pharyngeal precursor cells arrange in a bilateral \u0093double plate\u0094 organization (Rasmussen et al., 2013). This is followed at 330-390 minutes by nuclear movement and constriction of cell\u0092s apical boundaries at the double plate midline leading to the formation of a compact \u0093cyst\u0094 pharyngeal primordium (Rasmussen et al., 2008; Rasmussen et al., 2013). These cells are attached to each other and to the midgut by adherens junctions. However, they are not yet attached to the buccal cavity (see Epithelial System - Hypodermis) (Portereiko and Mango, 2001). At this time, 78 of the 80 pharyngeal cells are already born. During the next hour, pharyngeal extension occurs such that the pharyngeal precursors reposition themselves to form a central cylinder and link to the buccal cavity, whereas the body myoblasts position themselves between this cylinder and the outer layer of cells. Pharyngeal extension is accomplished in roughly three steps: reorientation, epithelization and contraction (see Epithelial System - Hypodermis) (Portereiko and Mango, 2001). Later, the pharyngeal tube morphs into a bilobed structure and develops a lumen. Lumen formation is thought to be performed by retraction of the tips of the marginal cells from the midline of the pharyngeal primordium when the pharyngeal muscles differentiate and contract (PhaFIG 3E-G) (Leung et al., 1999). An exception to this is the pm8 and vpi1 cells at the posterior end of the pharynx, which form adjacent single cell tubes through detachment from the basal lamina, lamellar invasion, and self-fusion. vpi1 forms a toroidal tube during embryogenesis that connects with itself through self-fusion (Rasmussen et al., 2008).

Similar to the anterior hypodermal cells and the arcade cells, the cell bodies of the epithelial cells lie far posterior to the buccal cavity and extend thin processes anteriorly within the pharyngeal nerve cords to reach their territories surrounding the lumen (Albertson and Thomson, 1976). The most anterior epithelial cells, e1, are positioned as a single dorsal and two subventral cells, covering markedly thinner territories (as measured along the a/p axis) than the other six cells. The posteriormost cells, e3, are positioned in the same pattern, and their epithelial territories lie directly behind those of e1 cells. The intervening e2 cells lie at the three apices of the triangular lumen, and their epithelial territories span the width of both the e1 and e3 cells, yielding a sixfold symmetry. At their lateral borders, all of these epithelial cells are firmly connected to their immediate neighbors by large adherens junctions (running continuously at the apical border). Where the epithelial cells border the posterior arcade cells, there are again very prominent adherens junctions (PhaFIG5 D&E).\n\nThe pharyngeal epithelium is a rather rigid narrow cylinder that restricts entry of food into the pharynx. Its cylindrical shape is heavily reinforced by short radial bundles of intermediate filaments anchored to the apical and basal membranes of the epithelial cells by large hemidesmosomes. These well-anchored filaments seem to limit the epithelial cylinder from stretching or collapsing, despite the vigorous movements of the nearby pharyngeal musculature. The pharyngeal epithelial cells also secrete the cuticle that lines the buccal cavity along the former mesostom portion.\n\nThe inside caliber of the buccal epithelial lumen increases markedly at each larval molt, and this increase in size of the buccal cavity is suggested to permit increased growth rate after each molt (Knight et al., 2002). The buccal cavity is much narrower in the dauer larva, which stops actively feeding (DCutFIG4).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2784, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19754f99-960b-47e8-9f04-2373abe1d931": {"__data__": {"id_": "19754f99-960b-47e8-9f04-2373abe1d931", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Pharynx, Section 4) Muscle Cells of the Pharynx](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/pharynx/Phaframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "62040c20-eafc-42c4-a1de-9ca434124ed7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Pharynx, Section 4) Muscle Cells of the Pharynx](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/pharynx/Phaframeset.html)"}, "hash": "9781aa71cdb37ae77a5ea18511e12ca1e4b836998b1a2b9255b6ff57b5af9719", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The pharyngeal muscles are grouped into eight separate segments (pm1-pm8), which are arranged as eight consecutive rings encircling the pharynx (PhaFIG 6A-C; PharynxAtlas) (Albertson and Thomson 1976; Avery and Thomas, 1997; Franks et al., 2006). Unlike the body wall muscles, no hypodermal layer separates the muscle anchorage from the cuticle lining the lumen of the pharynx. Indeed, most of the pharyngeal muscles appear to participate directly in secreting cuticle (e.g., the two anteriormost pharyngeal muscle cells, pm1 and pm2, secrete the cuticle that lines the metostom and telostom portions of the buccal cavity) and thus qualify as having myoepithelial properties (Albertson and Thomson 1976, D.H. Hall, unpublished). Consistent with this, the pm1 cells are required for secretion of the metastomal flaps (Sando et al., 2021). Most of the pharyngeal muscle segments are made up of three syncytial cells positioned in a three-fold symmetrical manner in any cross section (PhaFIG 6D). Each of these cells contains two nuclei as a result of fusion of two cells around the time of hatching (See Table 1 in Albertson and Thomson 1976; see also PhaTABLE 1). In pm2-pm5 of adult pharynx, there are still small remnant adherens junctions at the sites of former cell fusions between pairs of muscle cells, marking the exact apical border where the fusion has occurred (PhaFIG 3) (Hedgecock and Thomson, 1982). These remnant junctions express the AJM-1 protein and can be stained by immunocytochemistry (Koppen et al., 2001; D.H. Hall, unpublished). The three muscle cells of each segment are separated from each other by three marginal cells, whereas the muscle cells of the neighboring rings are linked by gap junctions and also connected via interlocking short fingers on the anterior and posterior margins. Each syncytial muscle cell contains a deep groove on the basal side where a longitudinal pharyngeal \"nerve cord\" is situated (PhaFIG 6 and PhaFIG 7A). These nerve cords enclose the cell bodies and processes of neurons, gland cells, and anterior epithelial cells. Many synapses, including neuromuscular junctions onto the pharyngeal muscles, occur along these cords.\n\nSpecialized zones mark the apical regions of several of the pharyngeal muscles where they secrete cuticle. Here, the cytoplasm contains electron dense tubules, and sometimes, dense core vesicles just under the plasma membrane. The cytoplasm of pm6 is particularly specialized in the region underlying the grinder, which is a very elaborate cuticular structure secreted by the pm6 muscle cells (PhaFIG 2). During the lethargus period preceding each larval molt, pm6 and pm7 produce secretory vesicles, which interrupt the sarcomeres. Vesicles with electron dense cores predominate during shedding of the L4 cuticle, while electron lucent core vesicles are dominant during the formation of the adult cuticle (Sparacio et al., 2020). Prominent networks of sarcoplasmic reticulum along the borders of each muscle sarcomere presumably sequester calcium needed for muscle contractility. Pharyngeal muscle cells also contain many mitochondria.\n\nIn most pharyngeal muscle segments, contractile filaments are oriented radially, and when the muscles contract, the pharyngeal lumen opens. However, in the terminal bulb, the pm7 muscle filaments are oriented obliquely with regard to the anterior-posterior axis and pull on the grinder region when the muscle contracts. pm1-pm4 function in sucking up and trapping bacteria. pm5 regulates flow of food from corpus to the terminal bulb, and pm6-pm8 operate the grinder.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3584, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "15584509-94d7-4e0f-b7bc-3b89efe39352": {"__data__": {"id_": "15584509-94d7-4e0f-b7bc-3b89efe39352", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Pharynx, Section 5) Marginal Cells](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/pharynx/Phaframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a020eeb9-af58-44c0-a409-3056b3c4c9d9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Pharynx, Section 5) Marginal Cells](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/pharynx/Phaframeset.html)"}, "hash": "ec1faf98aa6e45cb4652d223775a5104f0cc1ea5d9b9b373333929b7e354b801", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The pharynx is a mosaic of several non-equivalent cell types, each with threefold symmetry that assemble into a nonstratified, one-cell-deep epithelium along the lumen (PhaFIG 7A; PharynxAtlas). As described above, muscle cells are a major part of this epithelium. Cells of another type, the marginal cells (mc), are placed at the three corners of the pharyngeal lumen and separate the muscle cells from one another. There are three mc segments along the pharynx and a total of seven marginal cells; three mc1 cells comprise the anterior segment, three mc2 cells comprise the second segment, and a syncytial mc3 cell with three nuclei comprises the terminal bulb segment (PhaFIG 1 and PhaFIG 6). From segment to segment, the marginal cells lie in rows at the corners of the lumen. They vary markedly in size between segments, but the three cells within one segment are essentially equivalent.\n\nMarginal cells supply reinforcing strength to this muscular organ. Their large size and block-like shape is fortified by the placement of large radial bundles of intermediate filaments running from apical to basal borders of each cell. These filaments are anchored to the plasma membrane by large hemidesmosomes. Within each segment, the marginal cells are linked to neighboring muscle cells on their lateral borders by large gap junctions as well as apical adherens junctions separating the membrane to apical and basal surfaces (PhaFIG 7B&C) (Avery and Thomas, 1997). Large interlocking finger-like extensions also connect marginal cells to muscles within each segment and may also add to the structural integrity of the whole organ. Because of this arrangement, marginal cells within a segment communicate with muscle cells of the same segment and not with other marginal cells. In contrast, between segments, these cells form interlocking fingers and gap junctions to neighboring marginal cells.\n\nThe marginal cells contain many mitochondria, which suggests that these cells may perform some active role beyond merely providing continuity and strength to the epithelium. Because marginal cells are coupled to pharyngeal muscles via gap junctions, they may have some motor function, i.e., they may be myoepithelial in nature. Alternatively, they may act as relay stations to synchronously transmit signals from motor neurons to surrounding pharyngeal muscles so that all pharyngeal muscles within a segment can contract and relax at the same time. It is noteworthy that when the pharyngeal muscles contract, the muscle cells become thinner to open the lumen. Because the marginal  cells are already relatively thin, this suggests that at full contraction, the pharyngeal lumen may open practically as wide as the inside corners of the marginal cells and form an open triangular lumen, whereas when the muscles relax, the lumen is practically closed except for the three channels at the apices of the anterior lumen.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2912, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "efb3a333-3858-43ea-894a-c4fda5808d13": {"__data__": {"id_": "efb3a333-3858-43ea-894a-c4fda5808d13", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Pharynx, Section 6) Gland Cells of the Pharynx](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/pharynx/Phaframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ae0ff070-1285-4710-aeb6-59e6365905c7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Pharynx, Section 6) Gland Cells of the Pharynx](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/pharynx/Phaframeset.html)"}, "hash": "dd179c0b3b76f3a6cf6688bf3edb79c7580c358048f2fca7853f26528c29da2c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Two classes of gland cells, g1 (three cells) and g2 (two cells), are found in the second bulb of the pharynx (PhaFIG 8; PhaMOVIE 3; PharynxAtlas).

Gland cell morphology is sculpted by surrounding muscle cells (PhaFIG 8H) (Raharjo et al., 2011). The g1 cells extend three cuticle-lined ducts anteriorly within the narrow pharyngeal nerve cords. Two of these ducts pass through the isthmus before emptying into the pharyngeal lumen near the first bulb. The dorsal g1 duct travels much farther and empties near the anterior limit of the pharynx. The g2 cells also extend ducts, which are much shorter and empty into the lumen of the second bulb. The g1 cells contain a lamellar cytoplasm and few vesicles, whereas the g2 cells have a rather clear cytoplasm and more vesicles. These contents may vary from animal to animal, and vesicle sizes are quite large and variable. Gland cells receive motor innervation from M4 and M5 motor neurons, which suggests that they may be stimulated to secrete digestive enzymes synchronously with pharyngeal pumping activity. Periodic episodes of secretion (vesicle motion) have been seen in g1 ducts by light microscopy and are apparently associated with molting (Singh and Sulston, 1978; Hall and Hedgecock, 1991).

Six types are bilaterally paired and eight are single neurons. These neurons extend processes anteriorly and/or posteriorly along the three longitudinal pharyngeal nerve cords (the dorsal and the right and left subventral) and form a small plexus (the pharyngeal nerve ring) within the anterior bulb where they decussate to the other side. A half-ring (the terminal bulb commissure) is made by neuronal processes more posteriorly within the anterior portion of the terminal bulb (PhaFIG 9 and PhaFIG 10). A few neurons (M1, M2 and M3) send out processes along unique routes. The M1 process runs anteriorly between the muscle and the right marginal cell until it reaches the pharyngeal nerve ring where it relocates to the dorsal nerve cord and continues traveling anteriorly in this location. Unlike other neuron processes, M2 and M3 processes do not make their dorsal turn within the pharyngeal nerve ring, but more anteriorly within the pm4 where they pierce through the pm4 as they travel towards the dorsal side to enter the dorsal nerve cord (PhaFIG 10E-J). M2 neurons make synapses to pm4 along the way.\n\nMost of these processes interact synaptically with others within the pharyngeal nerve ring, formed between the narrow region where pm4 and pm5 appose each other (PhaFIG 9). These synapses are of the en passant type, similar to those seen in the somatic neurons. The pharyngeal motor neurons also form neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) onto pharyngeal muscles. Interestingly, all non-neuronal cells receive some synaptic input (Cook et al., 2019). Unlike NMJs between somatic neurons and body wall muscles, no basal lamina has been found separating the neurons from muscles in the pharynx. There are no direct contacts between pharyngeal neurons and the larger somatic nervous system except the gap junctions made between RIPL/R neurons and the pharyngeal I1s, and gap junctions between RIPL/R and the pharyngeal motor neuron, M1 (Albertson and Thomson, 1976; Avery and Thomas, 1997). Ablation of RIP cells results in only a minor effect on pharyngeal function such that the brief inhibition of pumping in response to light touch to body disappears (Avery and Thomas, 1997). It is possible that one or more pharyngeal neurons, such as NSM cells, could secrete hormonal factors into the pseudocoelom to influence the rest of the animal. Otherwise, pharyngeal and somatic nervous systems function more or less independently of each other. A dissected and isolated pharynx continues its normal pumping behavior (Avery et al., 1995).\n\nIn fact, generation of electrical potential changes required for pharyngeal pumping is probably intrinsic to the pharyngeal muscle cells themselves since pumping behavior continues even when all the pharyngeal neurons are ablated (Avery and Horvitz, 1989). Although pumping can still occur after complete ablation of the pharyngeal nervous system, four of the pharyngeal neurons, MC and M3 motor neuron pairs, are important for the regulation of the pump motion.\n\nPharyngeal neurons fall into three categories: motorneurons, interneurons and other neurons. However, this distinction is somewhat arbitrary because most of these neurons have structures that suggest mixed functions.\n\n7.1 Pharyngeal Motor Neurons", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3395, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "66eedb3a-4d1d-4446-814b-b7c09152389d": {"__data__": {"id_": "66eedb3a-4d1d-4446-814b-b7c09152389d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Pharynx, Section 7.1) Pharyngeal Motor Neurons](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/pharynx/Phaframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "58bbb552-e771-4eb6-b085-3253be00761a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Pharynx, Section 7.1) Pharyngeal Motor Neurons](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/pharynx/Phaframeset.html)"}, "hash": "32a47f29a9e2781ff715d3d90b1e731bb81a76a4f06f99621f2bf9738e8ea0d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "7.2 Interneurons", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 16, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "63534221-bd6e-4c59-a2df-8f771f8c3c01": {"__data__": {"id_": "63534221-bd6e-4c59-a2df-8f771f8c3c01", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Pharynx, Section 7.2) Interneurons](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/pharynx/Phaframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b87302d7-fc62-455a-ac4d-02fda84657af", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Pharynx, Section 7.2) Interneurons](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/pharynx/Phaframeset.html)"}, "hash": "673b9b78d0f05ac7ad6e7d1dd5af9fcbbc5c195d3f3612e7bc5cdb54524f229f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "I1, I2, I3 and I6 are unbranched bipolar cells.

The MC cell forms an unexposed sensory structure close to the sieve, while the NSM neurons each have an exposed sensory structure there (PhaFIG 11). The NSM ending expresses an Acid-Sensing Ion Channel (ASIC), DEL-7, at this structure.

Many more synapses were added, and the previous wiring documented by Albertson and Thomson (1976) was verified. Virtually every cell in the pharynx of any type is now known to be included in this local circuitry. Re-analysis of the revised connectome has revealed how those circuits can be parsed into several distinct modules that match known stages in pharyngeal behavior: 1) pumping, 2) neuromodulation, 3) peristalsis, and 4) grinding (Cook et al., 2020) (PhaFIG 11).\n\nIt is also interesting that the neuropeptides and receptors that interconnect the pharyngeal neurons appear to be somewhat separate from the peptidergic system of the somatic nervous system (see Figure 5 in Beets et al, 2023). There are exceptions: for instance the common FRPR-7 receptor proteins expressed in many pharyngeal neurons, are responsive  to the FLP-1 ligand released by the AVK neurons of the nerve ring. Several classes of pharyngeal neurons also produce neuropeptide ligands that principally target somatic neurons (Beets et al, 2023). These peptidergic connections tend to operate at a distance, and do not require close contact, nor do they shadow the chemical and electrical wiring of the nervous system.\n\n7.5 Other Neurons", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1541, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "86bef1bf-91fd-4802-9bc8-8fceecfb37ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "86bef1bf-91fd-4802-9bc8-8fceecfb37ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Pharynx, Section 7.5) Other Neurons](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/pharynx/Phaframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "efb55b41-1cc7-4966-b997-f440b4b067f4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Pharynx, Section 7.5) Other Neurons](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/pharynx/Phaframeset.html)"}, "hash": "2b120e04fc5240af46f8f39f1c91157a4fbd8c1e8effbf4f9f6e5afcf78e8e68", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "MC neurons are a pair of bipolar cells situated within the anterior bulb that make chemical synapses exclusively onto marginal cells (Cook et al., 2019). The motor-interneuron, MI, is a single unipolar cell situated in the dorsal side of the anterior bulb and synapses onto both muscle and other neurons. The neurosecretory-motor neurons NSML and NSMR send out branches that form varicosities and contain mixed-sized vesicles (PhaFIG 9). The two main processes of the NSMs run in close apposition to the pseudocoelom over most of their length and form some release sites towards this space. NSMs are serotonergic. These cells may have both neurosecretory and motor functions and may communicate the presence of food to the rest of the animal's body. Exogenous application of serotonin stimulates pumping, decreases locomotion and stimulates egg-laying (Horvitz et al., 1982). The same responses are seen in the presence of bacteria in the environment. NSMs were thought to be potential candidates for mediating the effects of endogenous serotonin. However, ablation of NSMs has only subtle effects on pumping, suggesting that they may be redundant for this function (Avery et al., 1993, Avery and Thomas, 1997). The slowing of locomotion in the presence of bacteria becomes more enhanced in animals that were previously food-deprived, compared to well-fed animals. This phenomenon is described as \"the enhanced slowing response.\" When NSMs are ablated there is a small but significant decrease in this enhanced slowing of locomotion, which suggests NSMs contribute to this behavior (Sawin et al., 2000).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1603, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3cbbcb46-5132-4d1e-b570-0f0b95a4f697": {"__data__": {"id_": "3cbbcb46-5132-4d1e-b570-0f0b95a4f697", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Pharynx, Section 8) Pharyngeal-Intestinal Valve (VPI)](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/pharynx/Phaframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ec96ff7c-0d71-4bfa-9976-6e12445436ca", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Pharynx, Section 8) Pharyngeal-Intestinal Valve (VPI)](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/pharynx/Phaframeset.html)"}, "hash": "7f8d7a26c49ce439394f583ad72970817ad48e71ffdb99d412c46dadd4ba040b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "No apparent muscular elements operate within the valve cells, nor are there any muscles attaching to this valve from the outside.

The pharyngeal cuticle is formed by the pharyngeal epithelium and the muscle cells to cover the apical surfaces of many cells acting in concert, much as the thickened pharyngeal basal lamina is formed jointly on basal surfaces of the pharyngeal cells. Unlike the body cuticle (see Hermaphordite Cuticle), this cuticle shows no layers; however, it shows some reinforcement at points of stress. For instance, it becomes keratinized to stain more densely by TEM at certain regions. Other specialized portions of the pharyngeal cuticle include the following.\n\n9.2.1 Bridging Cuticle\n\nA small discrete region of cuticle connects the body wall cuticle covering the lips to the cuticle lining the buccal cavity. This bridging cuticle lies on the outer face of the anterior arcade and may also be touched briefly by the posterior arcade (see Epithelial System - Interfacial Cells; InterFIG 1).\n\n9.2.2 Flaps\n\nThe metastomal flaps are cuticular projections at the base of the buccal cavity and may correspond to the onchia or buccal teeth described in other nematode species (Chitwood and Chitwood, 1950; Theska and Sommer, 2023; see also PhaFIG 2; PhaFIG 5; InterFIG 1). Three flaps extend inward from the level of from the pharyngeal muscle cells pm1 and pm2 to restrict the intake rate of bacteria at the rear of the buccal cavity (Fang-Yen et al., 2009). The flap cuticle is very electron dense, suggesting a sclerotic hardening to stiffen the flaps and the entryway to the true pharynx.\n\n9.2.3 Grinder\n\nThe grinder (PhaFIG 2) is a cuticle specialization with five distinct layers (Sparacio et al., 2020). Its three contact zones, made by the three pairs of muscle cells, rotate when the muscles contract (Avery and Thomas, 1997). The food caught and ground up between the teeth is passed back to the intestine through the pharyngeal-intestinal valve. Relaxation of the terminal bulb returns the grinder to its resting state. The grinder is made primarily by pm6 and pm7 muscles, which produce large quantities of secretory vesicles during periods of lethargus when the grinder is rebuilt (Sparacio et al., 2020). During the initial breakdown, pm6 and pm7 vesicles have an electron dense appearance, whereas later during the reformation of the new grinder most vesicles have an electronlucent appearance suggesting distinct enzymes for the absorption and building of the grinder structure. Its three contact zones, made by the three pairs of muscle cells, rotate when the muscles contract (Avery and Thomas, 1997). Although the pm6 muscle filaments are oriented in radial fashion to the grinder, some portions of the pm7 muscles are oriented obliquely to the anterior-posterior axis and are anchored on the basal pole to the rear of the terminal bulb. During lethargus, the muscle striations appear to be interrupted suggesting a temporary differentiation from a muscular to a secretory cell type. The pm6 and pm7 muscle fibers pull from the posterior side of the teeth, and coordinated action of these muscles may then rotate the grinder segments and force the teeth to scrape past and engage one another.\n\n9.2.4 Pharyngeal Sieve\n\nThese finger-like extensions from the pharyngeal cuticle probably act to trap bacteria, just posterior of the metacorpus (Fang-Yen et al., 2009; PhaFIG 2). They extend from the cell borders where pm4 muscles meet the neighboring mc1 cells. They project over a region of about 20 \u03bcm in length within the narrow lumen, ending near the transition of the metacorpus to the isthmus.\n\n9.3 Gap Junctions (see also chapter on Gap Junctions)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3755, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a8588493-0eb1-4b99-b661-6029133c798b": {"__data__": {"id_": "a8588493-0eb1-4b99-b661-6029133c798b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Pharynx, Section 9.3) Gap Junctions](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/pharynx/Phaframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "53161707-a539-498f-8200-dd3b9b38e155", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Pharynx, Section 9.3) Gap Junctions](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/pharynx/Phaframeset.html)"}, "hash": "a16e0a130b0aed6205ae55d47c82abfed07d7a54013a159c005d713104649b19", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The muscle cells and the marginal cells of the pharynx are linked to and communicate with each other via elaborate gap junctions (Phelan, 2005; Altun et al., 2009; Bhattacharya et al., 2019; see also PhaFIG 7; PhaTABLE 1).

Particles (bacteria) are taken in as suspended in liquid and then trapped in the pharynx while the liquid is expelled outside by the function of the corpus and anterior isthmus (Avery and Thomas, 1997; Avery and Shtonda, 2003). The particles are then transported to the terminal bulb, ground and passed into the lumen of the intestine. The feeding behavior consists of two motions; pumping, a contraction-relaxation cycle involving the corpus, anterior half of the isthmus and terminal bulb; and posterior isthmus peristalsis. Pumping involves near-simultaneous contraction of the muscles of the corpus, anterior isthmus and terminal bulb followed by near-simultaneous relaxation. When a feeding motion begins, contraction of the corpus and anterior isthmus opens their lumens, sucking particles and liquid in, whereas contraction of the terminal bulb muscles breaks up already-trapped bacteria and passes the debris posteriorly towards the intestine (Avery and Shtonda, 2003). At this stage corpus and anterior isthmus are separated hydrodynamically from the terminal bulb by a closed isthmus. During the relaxation period that follows, the lumens of the corpus and the anterior isthmus close, allowing for the liquid to be expelled through the radial channels while bacteria are retained and the grinder returns  to its resting position (Fang-Yen et al., 2009). Food particles are trapped at two locations: the anterior procorpus and anterior isthmus. At each location, early relaxation of the pharyngeal lumen just anterior to the trap location prevents particles from exiting the trap (Fang-Yen et al., 2009). When the muscles again contract, the bacteria are carried further posteriorly by the inflow of liquid. Roughly one out of four pumps is followed by a posterior isthmus peristalsis where the trapped bacteria are carried from the anterior isthmus backwards to the grinder. Although each pm5 muscle cell runs the entire length of the isthmus, peristalsis occurs as a wave that propagates from anterior to posterior instead of simultaneously along its length. This capacity of isthmus for asynchronous contraction is suggested to permit the terminal bulb and corpus lumen to be at different pressures (Avery and Thomas, 1997).\n\nNeural control of feeding has been elucidated through both neuronal ablation and optogenetic manipulation of neuron activity (Avery and Horvitz, 1989; Trojanowski et al., 2014). Interestingly, pumping continues even after ablation of all pharyngeal neurons, albeit at a highly reduced rate (Avery and Horvitz, 1989). However, elimination of cholinergic signaling leads to a complete loss of pumping (Avery and Horvitz, 1990; Alfonso et al., 1993).\n\nIsthmus peristalsis is controlled by M4. Ablation of M4, which innervates the isthmus and terminal bulb muscles, leads to faulty isthmus peristalsis and a \u0093stuffed\u0094 worm appearance where food remains stuck in the isthmus, eventually leading to starvation (Avery and Horvitz, 1989). M4 also plays a minor role in pumping with optogenetic excitation of M4 leading to an increase in the pumping rate. Conversely, optogenetic inhibition or ablation of M4 causes a decrease in the pumping rate (Raizen et al., 1995; Trojanowski et al., 2014).\n\nThe rate of pumping is controlled by the MC, M2, and M4 motor neurons (Avery and Horvitz, 1989; Trojanowski et al., 2014). The I1 neurons, which make the only connection to the somatic nervous system, regulate pumping via the MC and M2 neurons. The MC, M2 and M4 neurons are cholinergic excitatory motor neurons (Raizen et al., 1995; Keane and Avery, 2003). Mutants in which acetylcholine synthesis (cha-1) or packaging (unc-17) is disrupted show a pumping defect similar to that seen after MC ablation.

Functional studies suggest that MC neurons synapse onto pm4 and that synaptic transmission from MC neurons to pm4 requires the nicotinic acetyl-choline receptor (nAChR) subunit, EAT-2 to be expressed on pm4. MC neurons may also be mechanosensory, because they have free endings at the boundary between the procorpus and metacorpus and may sense the presence of bacteria in the pharynx.\n\nPumping is suppressed during dauer, lethargus, and in response to a touch stimulus in adults. As described above, the latter response depends on an RIP/I1 connection. This circuit may also be important for suppression of pumping in the dauer larva (Keane and Avery, 2003). Inhibition of pumping during the dauer stage may save energy and prevent ingestion of environmental toxins when no appropriate food is available.\n\nFeeding behavior is also impacted by exposure to light (Bhatla and Horvitz, 2015; Bhatla et al., 2015). Following exposure to light, feeding is inhibited and a subsequent reversal of flow in the pharynx leads to expulsion of bubbles (\u0093spitting\u0094) from the mouth. Light-induced inhibition of feeding acts through both the I2 neurons and the RIP/I1 connection. The I2 neurons, which were originally classified as interneurons, also synapse directly onto pharyngeal muscle (Bhatla et al., 2015; Cook et al., 2019).

Laser ablation of the AVL and DVB neurons together eliminate enteric muscle contractions. AVL is an excitatory \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneuron/motorneuron that is located in the head and sends a process  to the tail. It influences the enteric muscles indirectly via gap junctions with DVB (see also Gap Junctions). Killing AVL alone causes a strong anterior body muscle contraction (aBoc)-defective defecation phenotype. Because this defect is not seen in mutants that lack GABA, AVL may also use a non-GABAergic signal to activate other motor neurons that control anterior body wall muscle contraction. DVB is a GABAergic motor neuron located in the dorsorectal ganglion in tail (NeuroFIG 18). It is born post-embryonically at late L1 stage and is the daughter of the K rectal epithelial cell. DVB extends a prominent process anteriorly that passes through a commissure beneath the depressor muscle and extends forward along the top of the ventral hypodermal ridge. In this region, its large axon is filled with synaptic vesicles and makes periodic synapses to muscle arms from enteric muscles. The excitatory GABAergic signal from AVL and DVB is thought to be mediated by the nonselective cation-channel-type GABA receptor EXP-1 because exp-1 mutants lack enteric muscle contractions and are phenotypically constipated (Thomas, 1990; Beg and Jorgensen, 2003).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1509, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3840aeb4-6728-47d0-a11c-b282580e1e06": {"__data__": {"id_": "3840aeb4-6728-47d0-a11c-b282580e1e06", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Rectum and Anus, Section 7) Defecation Motor Program](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/rectum/Rectframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f1582b5b-5c36-4bb8-800a-6cb3cdded6cb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Rectum and Anus, Section 7) Defecation Motor Program](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/rectum/Rectframeset.html)"}, "hash": "f369e80d371a7520a5b83ef24d90b04e57ffd29026f0a00ca17cf10779ace299", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "In C. elegans, defecation consistently occurs approximately every 50 seconds and has five cycle components: an intercycle period, pBoc (posterior body muscle contraction), pBoc relaxation, aBoc and EMC (enteric muscle contraction) which is also called the expulsion (exp) step (Avery and Thomas, 1997). In the hermaphrodite, each defecation starts with pBoc, which squeezes intestinal contents anteriorly. Approximately 1 second later, relaxation occurs and intestinal contents flow posteriorly. Next, aBoc is initiated by contraction of the body muscles near the head, and gut contents are concentrated near the anus. Finally, contraction of the enteric muscles expels the gut contents out of the animal and the intercycle period starts. The motor components of defecation behavior (pBoc, aBoc and EMC) constitute the defecation motor program (DMP). Defects in any of the motor components of DMP lead to constipation. During larval stages the hindgut structures of the male are virtually identical to those of the hermaphrodite. In the adult male although DMP is similar to the hermaphrodite, the anatomy and control of the hindgut changes drastically (see Male - Defecation Muscles, Male Muscles - Overview).\n\nThe steps of the DMP are coordinated in precise temporal and spatial sequences. The ultradian defecation rhythm can be reset by light touch stimulus to the body and is thought to be controlled by an intestinal pacemaker that keeps time and activates the posterior body contraction at the start of each cycle (Dal Santo et al., 1999; Siklos et al., 2000). An essential element of this pattern generator and time keeper is the periodic, autonomous calcium release mediated by the inositol trisphosphate (IP3) receptor ITR-1 in the posterior intestine (Dal Santo et al., 1999). Intestinal calcium levels oscillate with the same periodicity as the defecation cycle and reach their peak levels just prior to the first muscle contraction (pBoc) step. Transient increases in calcium ions then propagate from the posterior to the anterior intestine (Espelt et al., 2005; Teramoto and Iwasaki, 2006). Blocking propagation of this calcium wave stops the later phases of the defecation motor program.\u00a0 In addition, mutations in itr-1 slow down or eliminate the cycle, further supporting the idea that IP3 receptor activity and calcium release rather than neuronal control sets the defecation cycle frequency. Nevertheless, the GABAergic motor neurons, AVL and DVB are required for the execution of the anterior body contraction and the enteric muscle contractions for expulsion (McIntire et al., 1993; Avery and Thomas, 1997). An intercellular signal originating from the calcium oscillations in the posterior intestine may activate these two neurons for later muscle contractions.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2782, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2b525eee-628d-42ff-aa6c-dc3ab2a4cff0": {"__data__": {"id_": "2b525eee-628d-42ff-aa6c-dc3ab2a4cff0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Rectum and Anus, Section 8) List of Cells of the Rectum and Anus](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/rectum/Rectframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4cca3398-d86f-4375-be7e-12fe4090f02d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Rectum and Anus, Section 8) List of Cells of the Rectum and Anus](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/rectum/Rectframeset.html)"}, "hash": "dfaa90b9f1d0497f2836e7a73b6e332125ba378ff023382491970708da76b0d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 0, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9389e766-cf7e-48bb-a3cc-5234f9168276": {"__data__": {"id_": "9389e766-cf7e-48bb-a3cc-5234f9168276", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Rectum and Anus, Section 9) References](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/rectum/Rectframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ea10fa30-f484-44b7-9b10-12e772a7f289", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [Rectum and Anus, Section 9) References](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/rectum/Rectframeset.html)"}, "hash": "dfaa90b9f1d0497f2836e7a73b6e332125ba378ff023382491970708da76b0d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 0, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "264d3b79-cccd-47bd-b0ab-80c3a4500169": {"__data__": {"id_": "264d3b79-cccd-47bd-b0ab-80c3a4500169", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [The Cuticle, Section 1) General Description](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/cuticle/Cutframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fdd947ae-8687-48b5-b099-56a1ccdca034", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [The Cuticle, Section 1) General Description](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/cuticle/Cutframeset.html)"}, "hash": "f326171ab944b138dc3f175b3ae55268ba04ef3e2872a9ccf3ab3e8a5b91e2f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The outer surface of the animal is covered by a tough, but flexible, extracellular cuticle (CutFIG 1).

Mutant phenotypes range from abnormal surface epitope expression (Srf, surface antigenicity abnormal phenotype) and pathogen resistance (e.g. Bus, bacterially unswollen) to altered body shape (Rol, roller; Dpy, dumpy; Sqt, squat; Lon, long) or abnormal cuticle morphology (Bli, blister) (Brenner, 1974; Higgins and Hirsh, 1977; Kusch and Edgar 1986; Politz et al., 1990; Link et al., 1992; Kramer and Johnson, 1993; Nicholas and Hodgkin, 2004). The most abundant structural components of cuticle are collagens and the non-collagenous cuticulins (Sebastiano et al., 1991; Lewis et al., 1994; Kramer, 1997). These molecules assemble into the relatively insoluble, higher-order complexes that form the cuticle matrix. Collagens COL-19 (CutFIG 5A) and BLI-1 (CutFIG 5B) localize to the adult cortical layer and (Liu et al., 1995; Thein et al., 2003) medial layer struts, respectively (J. Crew and J.M. Kramer, pers. comm.); DPY-7 (CutFIG 5C) localizes to the furrows in all stages (McMahon et al., 2003). Although few have been characterized, the cuticle probably also contains many soluble proteins such as enzymes involved in post-secretion modification and cross-linking of matrix proteins or structural proteins associated with the surface coat (e.g. mucins). Lipids and glycolipids are found in the epicuticle layer, an atypical membrane. Carbohydrates are associated with glycosylated proteins of the matrix and of the surface coat (Blaxter and Robertson, 1998).\n\n\n\n Larval stage cuticles differ from adult in the type of layers present or their relative thickness (CutFIG 6 and DCutFIG 1). The dauer cuticle is further distinguished from those of other stages in being less permeable and proportionally thicker (10.2% of the animal's cross sectional area; c.f. 4.4% for other stages) because of a reduction in body diameter and an increase in epicuticle layer thickness (Cassada and Russell, 1975; Cox et al., 1981b).

These cuticles are secreted by underlying cells that are generally epithelial, although in the case of the buccal cavity and pharynx, other cell types may contribute (e.g. pharyngeal muscle cells). In contrast to body cuticle, cuticles that line the openings do not appear to be composed of layers. However, some contain specialized cuticular elements. The most striking examples are seen in the pharyngeal cuticle, which contains at least four different types of elements: bridging cuticle, flaps, grinder, sieve, and channels (CutFIG 7A, CutFIG 7B-E; Albertson and Thomson, 1976; Wright and Thomson, 1981).

Contraction of circumferential actin filament bundles, which lie beneath the surface of the hypodermal apical membrane, induce elongation of the embryo and simultaneously produces ridges and furrows in the hypodermis and an overlying lipid layer called the embryonic sheath (Priess and Hirsh, 1986). This surface is thought to serve as a template for cuticle annulations (CutFIG 9A) (Costa et al., 1997).\u00a0 A similar contractile mechanism may be employed to pattern later stage cuticles and, possibly, the formation of alae.\n\nFollowing hatching are four post-embryonic molts whereby an entirely new cuticle is synthesized and the old cuticle is shed. The new cuticle is laid down beneath the existing cuticle, with the outer layers synthesized first and the inner layers last. Seam cells, and to a lesser extent hypodermal cells, acquire large Golgi and have vesicles containing densely staining material, consistent with the notion that high levels of protein synthesis and secretion occur at this time (Singh and Sulston, 1978). The new cuticle is initially highly convoluted and the underlying hypodermis contains folds known as plicae (CutFIG 9B).\n\nConsistent with the cyclic nature of the molting process, synthesis of cuticle components is low between molts and high prior to molts (Cox et al., 1981c). Transcriptional analysis of collagen gene activity reveals multiphasic waves of early (e.g. dpy-7), middle (sqt-1 , dpy-13), and late (col-12) gene expression. It is hypothesized that collagens that are produced cotemporally may be incorporated into the same heteromeric complex or cuticle substructure (Cox et al., 1981c; Cox and Hirsh, 1985; Park and Kramer, 1994; Johnstone and Barry, 1996; McMahon et al., 2003). Some cuticle proteins are synthesized at every molt (e.g. COL-12) whereas others are stage-specific e.g., adult-specific COL-19 and BLI-1 (CutFIG 5A&B).\n\nMolting consists of two phases: lethargus, the period of inactivity preceding cuticle shedding, and ecdysis or cuticle shedding (Singh and Sulston, 1978). In the first half of lethargus pharyngeal pumping and locomotion decrease and seam cells lose their granular appearance. Immobility is thought to result from the separation of the basal zone in the old cuticle from the underlying hypodermis. Loosening of the old cuticle begins around the head, then moves to the buccal cavity and the tail. In the second half of lethargus, the worm begins to spin and flip around its long axis. The pharynx contracts and its cuticle lining breaks; the posterior half passes into the intestine and the anterior half is expelled and shed with the body cuticle. At this time, refractile granules are apparent in the pharyngeal gland cell processes and are thought to play a role in ecdysis.\u00a0 As in insects, molting in C. elegans appears to be regulated by nuclear hormone receptors (Kostrouchova et al., 1998, 2001).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2966, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e445555f-fd9a-4e51-89eb-972953769220": {"__data__": {"id_": "e445555f-fd9a-4e51-89eb-972953769220", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [The Cuticle, Section 6) Cuticle Attachment Complexes](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/cuticle/Cutframeset.html)"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bb92036c-993d-49bd-8274-cef45191ba84", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"source document": "WormAtlas Handbook: [The Cuticle, Section 6) Cuticle Attachment Complexes](https://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/cuticle/Cutframeset.html)"}, "hash": "8b9427a7a209449b07ec4d1ab700897da12c30285c310868d214c56e483f9fcc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Locomotion requires the transmission of contractile force from body wall muscle to the cuticle.This force is transmitted through a series of mechanical linkages connecting body wall muscle, basal lamina, hypodermis and cuticle (CutFIG 10, CutFIG 11). The inner layer of the cuticle is attached to the apical hypodermal membrane through electron-dense attachment complexes, called hemidesmosomes, from which intermediate filaments extend into the cytoplasm. Similar complexes are also present on the basal hypodermal membrane and when apical and basal complexes are in register, a fibrous organelle (FO) is formed. Anchoring fibrils extend from FOs into the extracellular basal lamina, which is linked, in turn, to muscles through the M line and dense bodies of the sarcomere (Francis and Waterston, 1991; Hresko et al., 1994, 1999; Bercher et al., 2001; Hong et al., 2001; Hahn and Labouesse, 2001) (see also Somatic Muscle).
